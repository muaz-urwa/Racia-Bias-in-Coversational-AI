101,101,17400,How to Predict Gentrification: Look for Falling Crime - The New York Times,New York Times,Emily Badger,2017-01-12,2017.0,1.0,,"Everyone has theories for why     professionals are moving back into parts of cities shunned by their parents’ generation. Perhaps their living preferences have shifted. Or the demands of the labor market have, and young adults with less leisure time are loath to waste it commuting. Maybe the tendency to postpone marriage and children has made city living more alluring. Or the benefits of cities themselves have improved. “There are all sorts of potential other amenities, whether it’s cafes, restaurants, bars, nicer parks, better schools,” said Ingrid Gould Ellen, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. “But a huge piece of it,” she said, “I think is crime. ” New research that she has conducted alongside Keren Mertens Horn, an economist at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and Davin Reed, a doctoral student at N. Y. U. finds that when violent crime falls sharply, wealthier and educated people are more likely to move into   and predominantly minority urban neighborhoods. Their working paper suggests that just as rising crime can drive people out of cities, falling crime has a comparable effect, spurring gentrification. And it highlights how, even if many Americans  —   including, by his own words,   Donald Trump  —   inaccurately believe urban violence is soaring, the opposite   trend has brought   change to cities. “We’re trying to help people understand what a dramatic difference the reduction in violent crime in particular has made in our environment,” Ms. Ellen said. “That has repercussions far beyond what we think of. The homicide rate has gone down  —   that’s directly the most important consequence. But there are all sorts of repercussions as well. This really has been a sea change. ” Nationally, violent crime peaked in 1991. It fell precipitously for the next decade, then more slowly through the 2000s (and there’s a whole other set of theories about why that has happened). While homicides have increased recently in some cities, rates remain far below what they were 25 years ago, including in Chicago. (Another    reality check, while we’re at it: Mr. Trump said during the 2016 campaign that homicides in his new home in Washington were rising by 50 percent, apparently citing the previous year’s crime statistics. At that time in July, though, the rate in the city was already falling compared with 2015, and by year’s end, it was down by 17 percent.) The new research looked at confidential geocoded data from the 1990 and 2000 censuses, and more recent American Community Surveys, to identify the neighborhoods where more than four million households moved. Using citywide violent crime data from the F. B. I. the scholars tracked the changing probability of different demographic groups moving into central cities, as opposed to suburbs, as crime fell.   and   movers  —   and to a lesser degree, whites  —   appeared significantly more sensitive to changing crime levels in their housing decisions than other groups.   and minority households, for instance, didn’t become more likely to move to cities as they grew safer. That may reflect the fact, Ms. Ellen suggested, that   families have more experience or confidence in their ability to navigate crime. Or it may suggest that attention to violence is a luxury in housing decisions that the poor and minorities may not have. A household facing racial discrimination, high housing costs or the need to be near supportive family members simply has fewer options  —   and less leeway to be choosy  —   than the     households that this research identifies. “When cities feel safer, that opens people’s eyes,” Ms. Ellen said of the willingness of new groups to consider these neighborhoods. It’s entirely likely that the arrival of more affluent residents affected crime, too  —   either by increasing opportunities for property crime in the short term, or by adding eyes on the street and pressure on the police in the long run. Because this research looked at moves that occurred after crime was already falling, the authors believe the movers were reacting to changes in crime and not simply causing it themselves. But the relationship between crime and gentrification in particular is complex. Wealthier residents may bring new tensions to neighborhoods, fearing  —   and reporting  —   criminal activity where none exists. And such demographic change in cities could play a role in pressuring the police to pursue tactics that feel unduly aggressive to the people who preceded the newcomers. This study also doesn’t offer evidence that existing residents were displaced by the new arrivals. Many of the urban neighborhoods studied had lost population, so they had room to grow again without pushing existing residents out. But the possibility that these trends portend higher housing costs and more housing demand in the future in poorer, minority neighborhoods adds a cautionary note, Ms. Ellen said, to the declining crime trend."
122,122,17423,Beating of Disabled Teenager Highlights a Crime That Often Goes Unpunished - The New York Times,New York Times,Mitch Smith and Richard Pérez-Peña,2017-01-07,2017.0,1.0,,"CHICAGO  —   The appalling video seized the nation’s attention this week: A group of young people kidnapped, bound, beat, slashed, gagged, humiliated and threatened to kill a teenager with mental disabilities over nearly three days, and laughed about it as they carried out their acts. But by far, the most unusual thing about the episode, advocates for people with disabilities have said, was not the abuse itself, but the fact that it was recorded. Violence against people with disabilities is far more common than most people realize, advocates have said, and frequently goes undetected or is not taken seriously. The victim in the attack here, an    white man, suffered from schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder, prosecutors said in court papers filed on Friday. The four accused attackers, ranging in age from 18 to 24, are black. The four appeared on Friday in Cook County Circuit Court and Judge Maria Kuriakos Ciesil ordered them held without bail. The defendants are accused of multiple felonies, including hate crimes. Prosecutors said the victim, who was found by the police on Tuesday, was targeted based on his race and his disability. During a Facebook video made by one of the defendants, another can be heard denouncing white people, and, at one point, a man is heard saying he does not care if the victim is schizophrenic. “I’m wondering as I’m hearing this, ‘Where was the sense of decency?’ ” Judge Kuriakos Ciesil asked. In explaining her denial of bail, she added, “How do you put someone out there who has allegedly committed such horrible offenses against a person?” People with disabilities are more than twice as likely to be the victims of violent crimes as those without disabilities, according to a Justice Department report based on Census Bureau surveys. And people with mental disabilities are the most likely to be victimized. But some advocates claim the disparity is actually much greater, saying crimes against those with disabilities are less likely to be pursued by law enforcement. They believe people with disabilities may be unable to take part in a survey or go to the police, or may have trouble being understood. As a result, their complaints often are not taken seriously. “There are probably thousands of other cases just like this one in Chicago, and in some cases worse, that will never see the impact of the justice system because folks don’t know about it,” said Rebecca Cokley, the executive director of the National Council on Disability, a federal agency. “In a lot of cases with people with disabilities, the perpetrators are family members or caretakers, so what happens when the person who would have to take you to the police station is your abuser?” Advocates have said the underlying problem is a pervasive attitude, conscious or not, that people with disabilities are not fully human. They pointed to a recent case in Idaho, where a white high school football player was charged with shoving a coat hanger into the rectum of another teenager, who was black and had mental disabilities, after having harassed the student and directed racial slurs at him for months. Though the accused student was 18 at the time of the assault, he was sentenced to probation rather than prison. “We have, unfortunately, devalued disabled people forever, which means we devalue their suffering,” said Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network, a nonprofit advocacy group. “What we experience all the time is that police, prosecutors, judges say, ‘Oh, this case is hard, it’s not worth our trouble. This person is hard to understand, or they’re not credible, or they won’t stand up to  . ’” Mr. Decker said that when Congress spent years drafting, debating, and finally voting on hate crimes legislation, which passed in 2009, it was a struggle to ensure that it punished crimes singling out people with disabilities, as well as bias based on categories like race or sex.   of the 50 states have hate crimes laws, according to the   League, but 17 of them do not specify people with disabilities as a protected group. Vilissa Thompson, an organizer of the Harriet Tubman Collective, a coalition of advocates for disabled black people, said, “People are ignorant about the extent of violence against disabled people, but what’s worse is that there’s this kind of misplaced sympathy for the perpetrator, especially when it’s a parent or caregiver. ”"
679,679,18045,"Family DNA Searches Seen as Crime-Solving Tool, and Intrusion on Rights - The New York Times",New York Times,Eli Rosenberg,2017-01-28,2017.0,1.0,,"The leads have dried up in the killing of a young woman in Queens  during a jog last summer. Tips about potential suspects have gone nowhere. A reward has failed to bear fruit, even as it has swelled to over $280, 000. And the samples of a stranger’s DNA found on the hands, throat and cellphone of the jogger, Karina Vetrano, 30, did not match those in national offender databases. But the authorities say that the recovered DNA could hold the key to solving the case if state officials authorize what is called familial searching, which allows investigators to search criminal databases to identify likely relatives of the offender. The technique, which has been used more than a dozen times in the United States over the last 10 years, represents a frontier in the evolving world of forensic science. While some methods, like microscopic hair testing and   matching, have been challenged in recent years, DNA testing remains a staple of forensic investigation, used to both identify suspects and exonerate the wrongfully convicted. Familial searching allows investigators to search offender databases with wider parameters to identify people who are likely to be close relatives of the person who may have committed a crime. Law enforcement officials say a hit in the database is less a piece of evidence than it is a lead, and such matches have helped solve some heinous crimes in states where the practice has been authorized. But the method raises some complicated ethical issues that have trailed the expansion of DNA technology since its introduction. And as the collection of DNA grows in the private sector, so do the concerns about its potential misuse, particularly in the hands of government institutions. Problems at some laboratories, including the New York City medical examiner’s office, have highlighted how DNA evidence is not immune from human error. A 2013 review of more than 800 rape cases processed by the medical examiner’s office found that DNA evidence was mishandled in dozens of cases. In the case of Ms. Vetrano, who the police say was sexually assaulted and strangled,  lack of progress led Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, to push for familial searching. “The Police Department reached a point where they exhausted all their leads. And they came to us and said in essence, ‘What else can we possibly do? ’” Mr. Brown said in an interview. Mr. Brown and two of his deputies, Eric Rosenbaum and Robert J. Masters, said that Ms. Vetrano’s case presented an ideal situation for using familial searching, in part because of what they say is the high likelihood that the DNA is from the perpetrator. “It is a stranger rape case,” Mr. Masters said. “In the annals of law enforcement, there are few fact patterns that are more frightening. ” The New York State Commission on Forensic Science, a   panel appointed by the governor to develop standards for forensic laboratories, and its   DNA subcommittee will hold a meeting next month on whether to authorize the technique. Familial DNA searching was pioneered in Britain, helping in 2002 in what was believed to be the first conviction using the technique. In 2008, California became the first state in the country to authorize the testing, and Colorado followed a year later. It has now been used in at least eight other states. California has solved seven cases using familial searching, a spokeswoman for the state’s Justice Department said. One was the   Grim Sleeper case in Los Angeles. A serial killer preyed on vulnerable women and eluded identification for decades until investigators matched crime scene DNA to the killer’s son, whose DNA was in an offender database. “You’ve got a serial murderer or rapist in your community  —   you sit on your hands and wait for him to get in your database or do you try something?” said Mitchell R. Morrissey, an early proponent of the testing and a former district attorney in Denver. In New York, efforts to authorize such testing through the Legislature went nowhere several years ago. A compromise that allowed the authorities to use partial DNA matches automatically generated in the course of routine investigations has proved ineffective. But Ms. Vetrano’s case  —   along with the public pleas of her father, Philip, and his    work with the Police Department and elected officials  —   has   the push for familial searching. Critics of the technique say that regardless of its potential for success, it expands the use of DNA databases beyond their original intent. They fault it for allowing for searches of people who happen to be related to someone who has committed a crime, and say that given the composition of the offender databases, familial searching disproportionately affects blacks and Hispanics. “You’re creating a database of suspects largely defined by their race and class,” said Stephen Mercer, the chief attorney of the forensics division of the public defender’s office in Maryland, which outlawed the technique in 2008 in the face of these concerns. “That is just so fundamentally against our core values. ” The District of Columbia has also prohibited these searches. Leads provided by familial DNA have resulted in errors. A filmmaker in New Orleans was told that he was a suspect in a murder in Idaho based on a DNA sample given by his father years earlier as part of a   genealogy project. Ancestry. com, which had purchased the database from a nonprofit that had collected the DNA, was required by a court order to identify the man to the police. The man was cleared after his DNA  —   which he gave under a court order  —   was tested. Since then, Ancestry. com has made the database private and has not received any other requests from law enforcement officials for health or genetic information about an Ancestry member, a spokesman for the company said. The spokesman, Brandon Borrman, said the company would comply with such a request only if legally required. Proponents of the technique said the filmmaker’s case could have been handled differently DNA samples of potential suspects can be retrieved surreptitiously, from a discarded soda can, for example. But in some cases, that hasn’t been a ready option. Investigators chasing the   BTK serial killer in Wichita, Kan. compelled a hospital to turn over a sample of the suspect’s daughter’s DNA she had recently undergone a Pap test. That sample allowed the police to acquire an arrest warrant for the man, Dennis Rader. Mr. Rader later was sentenced to more than 170 years in prison after pleading guilty to 10 counts of   murder. The legal implications of familial testing, namely whether it is limited by the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of unreasonable searches or the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause, have not been tested in the courts, Erin E. Murphy, a law professor at New York University, said. She said the logic that law enforcement officials rely on to support familial testing should, by extension, support the testing of other government databases, which include repositories of DNA from members of the military, forensic personnel and crime victims. But such testing would most likely face wider opposition. “Familial searching is just an   around these debates,” said Professor Murphy, the author of “Inside the Cell: The Dark Side of Forensic DNA. ” “You shouldn’t have fewer civil rights because you’re related to someone who broke the law. ” A spokesman for Mr. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said it would be premature to answer questions about whether the office would seek to search other databases. If the DNA subcommittee and the New York State forensic commission vote to approve familial searching after the meeting on Feb. 10, a   period for public comment will follow. The Legal Aid Society and the New York Civil Liberties Union have both filed memos with the commission that question the method’s constitutionality as well as the commission’s authority to weigh in on the matter. Many law enforcement officials around the state said that any   in civil liberties were minor compared with the potential to solve some particularly difficult cases. “Invasion of privacy is basically what law enforcement does. We do it legally. We do it with warrants, court orders,” William J. Fitzpatrick, the Onondaga County district attorney and a proponent of the technique, said. Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is a member of the state forensic commission, compared the method to a tip from an informant. “You’re telling me that if I have a scientific piece of evidence that shows me a perpetrator’s son is in prison  —   what’s a better lead?” In New York City, the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, and the district attorneys from Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan and Staten Island, support authorizing the method. Mr. Vetrano acknowledges that the testing may not lead to his daughter’s killer, but he said he would continue to advocate its use. “This would have been left as a dead issue unless I started making waves,” he said. “I’m the squeaky wheel and I will never ever stop. ”"
1354,1354,18808,Hate Crime Is Feared as 2 Indian Engineers Are Shot in Kansas - The New York Times,New York Times,"John Eligon, Alan Blinder and Nida Najar",2017-02-27,2017.0,2.0,,"OLATHE, Kan.  —   “The Jameson guys,” as some on the staff at Austins Bar and Grill knew the pair, were on the patio on Wednesday evening. It was hardly unusual: Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India, often enjoyed an   whiskey at the bar they had adopted as a hangout. Adam W. Purinton was also there, tossing ethnic slurs at the two men and suggesting they did not belong in the United States, other customers said. Patrons complained, and Mr. Purinton was thrown out. But a short time later, he came back in a rage and fired on the two men, the authorities said. Mr. Kuchibhotla was killed, and Mr. Madasani was wounded, along with a    man who had tried to apprehend the gunman, who fled. Mr. Purinton, 51, was extradited to Kansas from Missouri on Friday, and he is charged with premeditated   murder and two counts of attempted premeditated   murder. The attack, which the federal and local authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime, reverberated far beyond both states. It raised new alarms about a climate of hostility toward foreigners in the United States, where President Trump has made clamping down on immigration a central plank of his “America first” agenda. The White House strongly rejected the notion that there might be any connection between the shooting and the new administration’s sharp language about immigration. “People are devastated,” said Somil Chandwani, a friend of the two victims who lives in Overland Park, Kan. “I wouldn’t say they are angry. They have a sense of insecurity at the moment. People are trying to find answers. ” A charging document released on Friday gave no details about the motive for the shooting. Law enforcement officials in Kansas, citing the continuing investigation and judicial ethics standards, said little about the episode. Still, the F. B. I. ’s role in the inquiry suggested that officials had found some evidence that could eventually lead to civil rights charges in connection with the shooting, which occurred around 7:15 p. m. Wednesday. “He snapped, and this is not his typical self,” the suspect’s mother, Marsha Purinton, said before declining further comment. In a brief phone interview on Friday night, Mr. Madasani described the remarks made Wednesday by the man sitting near him and Mr. Kuchibhotla at the restaurant. “He asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally,” Mr. Madasani said. (Both men were educated in the United States and were working here legally.) “We didn’t react,” Mr. Madasani said. “People do stupid things all the time. This guy took it to the next level. ” Mr. Madasani said he went in to get a manager, and by the time he returned to the patio, the man was being escorted out. After Mr. Purinton was thrown out, Jeremy Luby, 41, a software developer, said he offered to pick up the tab for the two men, who thanked him during a brief conversation about work and cultural differences. “It was wrong what happened to them,” Mr. Luby said. “I thought it was a nice gesture to say, ‘I’m sorry someone was being rude to you like that. ’” After the shooting began, another patron, Ian Grillot, 24, said he tried to count the shots while he hid under a table. Thinking the gunman had run out of ammunition, Mr. Grillot said, he confronted him, only to be shot in the hand and the chest. “It wasn’t right, and I didn’t want the gentleman to potentially go after somebody else,” Mr. Grillot said in a video released by the hospital where he received treatment. “He did it once. What would stop him from doing it again?” The shots echoed around the area, and Chris Lacross soon emerged from a store a few doors down to an unimaginable scene: an emergency medical technician performing CPR on a man lying in the doorway of the bar’s front patio, where tables and chairs had been flipped over, and someone was shouting that they needed towels. Another man took off his shirt and applied pressure to the wound of another victim, who was writhing in pain, said Mr. Lacross, who allowed some people to use a store restroom to wash away spattered blood. Within minutes, an emergency dispatcher, in a transmission archived by the Broadcastify website, told officers, “We’re being advised the suspect’s name is Adam, and he’s a white male wearing a white shirt with military medals. ” Capt. Sonny Lynch, the deputy chief of police in Clinton, Mo. where Mr. Purinton was arrested at an Applebee’s restaurant, said a bartender there called the police after a customer confessed to his involvement in a shooting hours earlier. “He was talking to her  —   ‘I’m on the run I’m hiding out from the law’  —   so she stuck around,” Captain Lynch said of the bartender. “She just hung out there talking to the guy until he said, ‘I shot those guys, and that’s why I’m hiding out from the police. ’” Mr. Purinton was arrested without incident, Captain Lynch said, and invoked his constitutional rights. It was not clear whether he had a lawyer. Mr. Purinton spent time in the Navy and, according to a website where veterans can list their military records, was deployed aboard the Long Beach, a missile cruiser, from 1988 to 1990. He later worked for the Federal Aviation Administration but left the agency in 2000, a spokeswoman said. In Johnson County, Kan. at least, he has had few   with law enforcement. Court records showed a limited history: a speeding ticket in 2008, as well as a 1999   charge that was dismissed. A neighbor, Lisa Puckett, said that Mr. Purinton was frequently intoxicated but that news of a shooting was stunning. “We always wondered if he might hurt himself, but we didn’t think he would hurt someone else,” she said. The dead man, Mr. Kuchibhotla, worked for Garmin, a GPS navigation and communications device company. One of the wounded men, Mr. Madasani, like Mr. Kuchibhotla in his early 30s, also worked for Garmin, according to the Indian government. On Friday, counselors were at the company’s campus in Olathe, a hub of South Asian immigrants where 84 languages are spoken in the local school district. Speaking to reporters on Friday at the Garmin headquarters, Mr. Kuchibhotla’s widow, Sunayana Dumala, said she had long been worried by shootings she read about in the newspaper. “I, especially, I was always concerned, are we doing the right thing of staying in the United States of America?” she said. “But he always assured me that only good things happen to good people. ” Now, Ms. Dumala said, she needed “an answer from the government” about what “they’re going to do to stop this hate crime. ” Mr. Madasani’s father, Jagan Mohan Reddy, a government engineer in Hyderabad, India, said his family was in shock. He said he did not know whether he would ask Mr. Madasani, who received a graduate degree from the University of   City, and another son living in the United States to leave the country. “We have to think it over,” he said. “My sons are not new to America. They have been staying there for the last 10 to 12 years. This is a new situation, and they are the best judges. ” Mr. Madasani, who has been released from the hospital, said he was recovering physically and mentally. “I’m definitely doing much better, but it’s not over yet,” he said. On Friday, Mr. Kuchibhotla’s killing and the wounding of Mr. Madasani led to a chorus of fury in India, where the attack dominated the news media to such an extent that the top American diplomat in the country was compelled to issue a statement condemning what she described as a “tragic and senseless act. ” In Washington, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, rejected any link between Mr. Trump’s policy agenda and the shooting, which many Indians believed might have been inspired by the president’s harsh tone on immigration. The Justice Department is under pressure to bring federal charges in the case. Moussa Elbayoumy, the board chairman for the Kansas chapter of the Council on   Relations, said the government should “consider filing hate crime charges in order to send a strong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated. ” On Friday night, a diverse crowd of more than 400 gathered to grieve at First Baptist Church down the street from the bar. They offered their prayers to the Kuchibhotlas and the Madasanis, characterized the shooting as an anomaly in an otherwise peaceful, tolerant suburb and vowed they would not let that change. “As a community, we are still shocked, devastated, and angry,”  Mayor Michael Copeland said. “But this is not how this ends. This is not our Olathe. ” He added, “One evil act does not divide a united community. ” Mr. Purinton was scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Austins, meanwhile, planned to reopen on Saturday."
1673,1673,19157,Justin Bieber Impersonator Is Charged With Child-Sex Crimes - The New York Times,New York Times,Dan Bilefsky,2017-03-10,2017.0,3.0,,"A    Australian man has been charged with committing more than 900   offenses after he was accused of pretending to be the pop star Justin Bieber to solicit explicit online photographs from children, the Queensland Police Service said on Thursday. The police said that the victims included dozens of Mr. Bieber’s fans in Australia, Britain and the United States. The    Canadian pop singer, whose rise to stardom was driven in large part by support from adoring young fans, is on tour in Australia. The suspect, who has not been identified by name, was already facing charges in Queensland State of possessing material exploiting children, and of using the internet and social media to entrap children under age 16, the police said. He now faces a further 931 criminal charges for offenses including rape, the indecent treatment of children and “making   material” that the police said stretched back at least a decade. The police raided the home of the suspect after he initially refused to allow access to his social media accounts. Investigators examined his computer, the police said, and found that he was using applications including Facebook and Skype to communicate with his victims and lure them into sending him explicit images. Detective Inspector Jon Rouse, who works on a Queensland Police Service task force devoted to combating the sexual exploitation of children online, described the offenses as “frankly horrendous. ” He said it was imperative that the parents of Bieber fans be vigilant. “This investigation demonstrates both the vulnerability of children that are utilizing social media and communication applications, and the global reach and skill that   offenders have to groom and seduce victims,” Inspector Rouse said in a statement. “The fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety. ” The case comes amid intensifying concern across the globe that children are being sexually exploited online. In Denmark, a    man recently went on trial accused of ordering the rape or sexual abuse of 346 Filipino children. At least one of the victims was as young as 3. Prosecutors said the man, a retiree living on the outskirts of Copenhagen, had paid for live, online sex shows from the Philippines. According to the international police organization Interpol, a majority of crimes against children usually take place within the home or the family circle. But Interpol has attributed a surge in   offenses to the internet, because it gives predators easy access to abusive material as well as a means to contact children via chat rooms or social networking sites. A recent study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime noted that social networking sites included an abundance of biographical information on potential victims that could be exploited by abusers, while children often lacked discretion and relied on a sometimes false sense of privacy and safety. “Offenders are able to gain easier access to larger and new populations of children through the use of online forums, email, social networks and other   communication tools,” the study said. The report also found that child abusers can have relatively high education levels, making them more adept at using technology."
1877,1877,19384,7 Congo Army Officers Charged With War Crimes in Massacre - The New York Times,New York Times,Steve Wembi,2017-03-18,2017.0,3.0,,"KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo  —   Seven Congolese Army officers have been arrested and charged with war crimes after a video surfaced last month that appeared to show uniformed soldiers opening fire on a group of civilians in a massacre that left at least 13 people dead, the military’s auditor general said on Saturday. The video depicts a squad of soldiers gunning down a group of people, which included women and possibly children, in Congo’s   Province. Most of the victims were unarmed, though a few men appeared to be holding slingshots. Several analysts who saw the video said that it revealed a   massacre of civilians and that the video could be used as evidence of war crimes. “In connection with this video, we have found seven suspects, all are F. A. R. D. C. elements, who are currently in detention,” said the auditor general, Gen. Joseph Ponde Isambwa, using an abbreviation for the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The officers, he said, had been charged with several crimes including “war crime by murder, war crime by mutilation, war crimes by cruel inhuman and degrading treatment and denial of an offense committed by persons subject to military jurisdiction. ” Among those arrested was Sgt. Maj. Maneno Katembo, a rifleman who is believed to have recorded the video. Congo has a history of   atrocities, including gang rapes and the slaughtering of civilians. The government initially labeled the video a hoax, before reversing itself and ordering the officers’ arrest. The country is nearly lawless, and the government forces are known to be brutal, underpaid and among the most dreaded. On Monday, two United Nations officials  —   an American and a Swede  —   were kidnapped along with four Congolese also in   Province. On Saturday, the United Nations mission in Kinshasa released a statement expressing concern over reports of renewed fighting in the restive region."
2179,2179,19718,Liked ‘Serial’? Here’s Why the True-Crime Podcast ‘S-Town’ Is Better - The New York Times,New York Times,Amanda Hess,2017-04-01,2017.0,4.0,,"In 2014, the   podcast “Serial” began like this: A tipster asked a radio journalist to investigate a murder. “” the new narrative podcast from the creators of “Serial,” kicks off in a similar fashion. This time, the tipster is John B. McLemore, an eccentric antique clock restorer from Woodstock, Ala. The journalist is Brian Reed, a longtime producer for “This American Life. ” When Mr. McLemore tells Mr. Reed that a Woodstock rich boy got away with murder and has been bragging about it ever since, Mr. Reed agrees to head down from New York to check it out. But it soon becomes clear that the homicide story is a bit of a red herring. It’s the hook to get Mr. Reed on the line. Mr. Reed has used a similar tactic to draw his podcast audience into the story, with a teaser for the series that emphasizes the murder. Some “Serial” fans may be disappointed to learn that the crew’s latest offering is not a straightforward whodunit. They shouldn’t be. “ ” turns out to be much more interesting than that. “ ” is not another tale of a journalist trying to solve a murder with just a microphone and a little elbow grease, and thank God. Instead, “ ” transcends the podcast procedural with a destabilizing narrative structure in which one   mystery leads to another, all surrounding Mr. McLemore and his acquaintances. There is that murder, but also a treasure hunt, a land grab and a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Reed’s investigation turns psychological and emotional  —   into how people come to be branded as bad, and the hidden relationships among men in the rural South. “ ”  —   which is executive produced by Mr. Reed and the “Serial” producer Julie Snyder, with editorial input from the “Serial” host, Sarah Koenig, and the host of “This American Life,” Ira Glass  —   is not “Serial” Season 3. It’s kind of a podcast spinoff, and it unfolds more like a novel than a   procedural. Mr. McLemore is its beguiling principal character. He’s got a backyard labyrinth, gold buried in an undisclosed location and a literary flair that turns   life into big drama. He’s the peppiest pessimist south of the   line. The “S” in “ ” is shorthand for a   word  —   Mr. McLemore’s preferred nickname for his hometown. He has a talent for profane rants about civilization’s downfall that he delivers in an Alabama drawl. In one diatribe, he rails against a nation of people who are “whiny, fat, flabby, out of shape,  ’ damn   peekin’ out the windows and snoopin’ around, listening on the cellphones and spyin’ in the peephole and peepin’ in the crack of the goddamn door, listenin’ in the [expletive] Sheetrock. ” Mr. McLemore takes a breath. “I gotta have me some tea. ” The chief innovation of “Serial” in its first season, which set out to reinvestigate the 1999 murder of a Baltimore high school student, was in the exposure of the inner workings of a journalistic criminal investigation as it happened. (The podcast’s underwhelming second season, which dug into the already   case of the American G. I. Bowe Bergdahl’s desertion, benefited less from that    aspect.) In “” Mr. Reed illuminates a different kind of reportorial experience. Almost every journalist has met people like Mr. McLemore, sources who email you under pseudonyms with tips a little too good to be true. Often they seem to mostly want someone to talk to, and to have their experiences validated by a journalist, whose job, after all, is to decide what’s important and true. Most reporters would stop taking those calls when the story ideas don’t bear fruit, but not Mr. Reed. He finds Mr. McLemore’s life important in and of itself, and a whole world opens up to him. A disappointment of the first season of “Serial” was that so many of its central players refused to talk  —   an understandable response to a journalist’s digging up of a    tragedy already decided upon by the courts. That often made for uncomfortable listening, as these actual people were posited as possible murder suspects on the basis of   claims. Accusations, criminal and otherwise, fly in “” too, but Mr. Reed manages to speak with just about all of the pivotal characters in the story, deftly interviewing them in a way that generates sympathy for their perspectives and illuminates their charms. Meeting these people provides delightful little surprises throughout the narrative: Among them is Uncle Jimmy, who communicates exclusively through shouted affirmations, and a man who divides his life into two eras: before and after the 2005 release of “Brokeback Mountain. ” Also, “ ” mercifully departs from “Serial” by releasing all of its seven episodes at once. The         style of “Serial” and stylistic offshoots like “Missing Richard Simmons” holds an addictive appeal, but it’s also a risky gambit that rarely pays off. The inevitable   frenzy to help crowdsource the mystery quickly turns the whole exercise into a dehumanizing game. It doesn’t work. Such podcasts often raise high expectations  —   let’s solve a murder, or at least flush out a reclusive celebrity  —   only to end in shrugs. Assembling the whole story before its release frees Mr. Reed to pace out a real narrative, including an emotional twist at the end of the second episode that turns the whole thing upside down. You should probably start listening now before somebody spoils the twist. But then, take your time with the story  —   “ ” is so much more than its central mystery."
2325,2325,19878,"Trump, Citing No Evidence, Suggests Susan Rice Committed Crime - The New York Times",New York Times,"Maggie Haberman, Matthew Rosenberg and Glenn Thrush",2017-04-06,2017.0,4.0,,"WASHINGTON  —   President Trump said on Wednesday that Susan E. Rice, the former national security adviser, may have committed a crime by seeking to learn the identities of Trump associates swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by United States spy agencies, repeating an assertion his allies in the news media have been making since last week. Mr. Trump gave no evidence to support his claim, and current and former intelligence officials from both Republican and Democratic administrations have said they do not believe Ms. Rice’s actions were unusual or unlawful. The president repeatedly rebuffed attempts by two New York Times reporters to learn more about what led him to the conclusion, saying he would talk more about it “at the right time. ” The allegation by a sitting president was a remarkable escalation  —   and, his critics say, the latest effort to change the story at a time when his nascent administration has been consumed by questions about any role his associates may have played in a Russian campaign to disrupt last year’s presidential election. Since March 4, when Mr. Trump posted on Twitter that President Barack Obama had “wiretapped” him at Trump Tower during the campaign, the president and his allies have repeatedly sought evidence trying to corroborate that claim, despite flat denials from James B. Comey, the director of the F. B. I. and other senior intelligence officials. Wednesday’s interview revealed how Mr. Trump seizes on claims made by the conservative news media, from fringe outlets to Fox News, and gives them a presidential stamp of approval and also increases their reach. Last week, some Republican television commentators asserted that Ms. Rice had improperly leaked the names of Trump associates picked up in surveillance of foreign officials. On Sunday, a conservative writer and conspiracy theorist reported, without identifying his sources, that Ms. Rice had been the one to seek identities of the Trump associates. Other conservative outlets picked up the report, and the Drudge Report website, which has been supportive of Mr. Trump, featured the story prominently. White House officials then accused mainstream news outlets of not giving the story proper coverage. The interview with The Times was supposed to be focused on Mr. Trump’s plans for   spending on the nation’s infrastructure. But moments after it began, the president began talking about Ms. Rice. “I think the Susan Rice thing is a massive story. I think it’s a massive, massive story. All over the world,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s a bigger story than you know,” the president added cryptically, also saying that new information would emerge “in terms of what other people have done also. ” “The Russia story is a total hoax. There has been absolutely nothing coming out of that,” he said. Turning the subject to Ms. Rice, the president said: “What’s happened is terrible. I’ve never seen people so indignant, including many Democrats who are friends of mine. ” Through a spokeswoman, Ms. Rice said, “I’m not going to dignify the president’s ludicrous charge with a comment. ” In an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday, Ms. Rice said she had done nothing wrong. “The allegation is that somehow the Obama administration officials utilized intelligence for political purposes,” Ms. Rice said. “That’s absolutely false. ” Normally, when Americans are swept up in surveillance of foreign officials by intelligence agencies, their identities are supposed to be obscured. But they can be revealed  —   or “unmasked”  —   for national security reasons, and intelligence officials say it is a regular occurrence and completely legal for a national security adviser to request the identities of Americans who are mentioned in intelligence reports. Intelligence officials said any requests that Ms. Rice made would have had to be granted by the intelligence agency that produced the report. In most cases, that would likely have been the National Security Agency, which is responsible for electronic surveillance of foreign officials. “Requests to learn the identity of a U. S. person were not routine, but also not uncommon,” said Stephen Slick, a retired C. I. A. official who served as the senior director for intelligence at the National Security Council under President George W. Bush. Requesting that a name be revealed so that officials could “make sense of an intelligence report was a normal part of the daily intelligence rhythm at the White House, State Department, Defense Department and other national security agencies,” added Mr. Slick, who is now the director of the Intelligence Studies Project at the University of Texas at Austin. It could be a crime if Ms. Rice leaked the name of any American wrapped up in the surveillance net, but she flatly denied doing so in her MSNBC interview. “I leaked nothing to nobody, and never have and never would,” Ms. Rice said. The broader issue of how intelligence collected by the national security apparatus is disseminated and used has long been an animating issue for civil libertarians, a point that Mr. Trump made in the interview. Revelations about American programs for intercepting and mining private data made by Edward J. Snowden, a government contractor, proved deeply embarrassing for the Obama administration in 2013. Mr. Trump declined to say whether he would be willing to declassify some of the information that has been at issue. He also did not explain what he believed was unlawful in his estimation. It is not the first time Mr. Trump has made a provocative allegation without providing supporting evidence. One of the most notorious instances of this was his yearslong claim that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. Like his statements about Mr. Obama  —   which he walked away from late in the 2016 presidential campaign  —   Mr. Trump’s claims about Ms. Rice have taken hold in the conservative news media, where she has been a target ever since her press appearances after the terrorist attack on a diplomatic outpost in Libya in September 2012. Mr. Trump’s March 4 Twitter message came after reports in conservative news outlets  —   including Breitbart, the website once run by the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  —   claiming that there had been surveillance of some kind against Mr. Trump when he was a candidate. Mr. Trump was widely criticized for the intemperate post, and he began to ask his advisers about how he might be able to investigate the issue. Weeks later, Representative Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, told reporters that he had learned of new information that Trump associates may have been surveilled in some way. He rushed to the White House to brief the president, even though it was later revealed that the information had come from White House officials. Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, cast Mr. Trump’s comments as part of a broader effort by the president to distract from the investigations into Russia’s interference in the election. The committee is running one of the investigations. “He began by accusing President Obama of a crime without any evidence,” Mr. Schiff said. “He’s now moved on to accusing Susan Rice of a crime without any evidence, and this is sadly how this president operates. ” It “would be a terrible way to do business,” Mr. Schiff added. “It’s a worse way to run a country. ”"
2560,2560,20141,"On Crime Bill and the Clintons, Young Blacks Clash With Parents - The New York Times",New York Times,Farah Stockman,2016-04-18,2016.0,4.0,,"Rufus Farmer, 33, was tired of all the ways he saw black men being mistreated by the nation’s law enforcement system  —   from the police officer who once berated him for crossing the street to the mandatory prison sentences that sent so many of his peers away. So when former President Bill Clinton appeared on April 7 in Philadelphia at a rally for his wife, Hillary, Mr. Farmer protested, carrying a sign denouncing Mr. Clinton’s 1994 crime bill, which set lengthy prison sentences and flooded the streets with police officers. A fiery exchange broke out between the activists and the former president as Mr. Clinton forcefully defended the legislation. But it was not just Mr. Clinton who criticized the young protesters. Afterward, some older   did, too. “I think it is crazy to protest the crime bill,” said Caryl Brock, 53, a social worker from the Bronx, who scolded the protesters on social media. “Should it be amended? Maybe. But a lot of people really wanted it. I really wanted it. ” Young and energized   this election cycle are aggressively challenging longstanding ideas and policies, especially those carried out during the Clinton administration in areas like crime and welfare. But the activism is also laying bare a striking generation gap between younger and older   whose experience, views of the former president and notions of how they should push for change diverge dramatically. The parents and grandparents of today’s young black protesters largely waged the battle for civil rights in courtrooms and churches. They carefully chose people who were viewed as upstanding citizens, like Rosa Parks, to be the face of their movement, and dressed in their Sunday best as they sought to gain broader acceptance. Mr. Clinton endeared himself to these generations by campaigning in black churches and appointing more blacks to the cabinet than any previous president had. But many of today’s activists  —   whose political consciousness has been shaped by the   killings of black people by the police  —   do not believe that acting respectfully will protect them from being harassed or shot. They aspire not to become a part of the political system, but to upend it. “You do have older generations of church folk who believe that marching and singing is the best way to bring about change,” Mr. Farmer said. “We’ll march, too, but we’ll do what we need to do to communicate our message, if it happens to be yelling, or blocking an intersection. And we don’t care if people  —   particularly white people  —   believe it is respectable. ” The gulf between young black people and their elders surfaced repeatedly in more than two dozen interviews conducted in the days after Mr. Clinton’s clash with the protesters. To young activists like Mr. Farmer, Mr. Clinton’s legacy on crime is paternalistic and damaging. But many older black voters who raised families during the crack epidemic  —   an era many young people do not remember  —   remain steadfastly loyal to the Clintons. Ms. Brock said she had been a social worker in charge of the removal of children from dangerous homes in the South Bronx and Spanish Harlem in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when crack tore a path of destruction through those neighborhoods. “I saw it all,” Ms. Brock said. “Moms would give birth and leave the hospital to get a hit. My car got broken into every week. People were scared to walk down to the bodega, afraid they’d be followed and robbed. ” She said she was relieved when the crime bill passed. In addition to providing more money for prisons and the police, the law banned assault weapons and offered funding for drug courts and rehabilitation. “Because of the crime bill,” she said, “anybody that wanted rehabilitation, we could process them and get them a detox bed in a hospital. ” Ms. Brock’s comments underscore a sometimes overlooked reality in today’s   of the crime bill: The legislation was broadly embraced by nonwhite voters, more enthusiastically even than by white voters. About 58 percent of nonwhites supported it in 1994, according to a Gallup poll, compared with 49 percent of white voters. Mr. Clinton has seemed rattled at times as he tries to defend the measure to younger   in an era in which concerns about mistreatment by the police and mass incarceration have eclipsed the fear of crime in many black communities. And among these younger voters, the Clintons lack the deep admiration that they enjoy from previous generations of  . In the Democratic primary contests so far, 92 percent of black voters 65 and older cast ballots for Mrs. Clinton, compared with 45 percent of black voters under age 25, according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research. Some   and older   found themselves siding with Mr. Clinton after his confrontation with the protesters in Philadelphia, which was widely broadcast on television and social media. During the exchange, Mr. Clinton said that the legislation targeted gang leaders “who got    children hopped up on crack and sent them out the street to murder other   children. ” He then lectured the activists, who support the Black Lives Matter movement: “You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter. ” Roz Rodgers, 55, a community engagement worker from East St. Louis, Ill. said she understood what Mr. Clinton was trying to get across. “All black lives should always matter  —   that is what Bill Clinton was saying,” Ms. Rodgers said. “It bothered me, the reaction he got. ” About the activists, she said: “This younger generation is more vocal. They are not accepting the rules, regulations and expectations that exist. ” Today’s angry demonstrations over   policies make it easy to forget how the former president was hailed two decades ago for taking a stand against gun violence in black communities. An emotional, unscripted speech Mr. Clinton gave in 1993 about the toll of violence on black youth has been called one the best of his presidency. He delivered it from the pulpit of the church in Memphis where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. preached his last sermon. “The other day on the front page of The Washington Post was a story about an    child planning her funeral,” Mr. Clinton told the congregation that day, 10 months before he signed the crime bill. “The freedom to die before you’re a teenager is not what Martin Luther King lived and died for. ” Black churchgoers gave him sustained applause and named him an honorary member of their congregation. A columnist in The Washington Post said the speech “embodied what has always been the promise of Clintonism. ” “Only Clinton could say it, and only now,” read a column in The St. Louis  . Willie W. Herenton, the first   mayor of Memphis, was in the church that day. “It’s easy for people to lose the connection of where we were in 1994 and where we are today,” Mr. Herenton said. The national murder rate hit a high in the early 1990s, disproportionately affecting   neighborhoods in major cities. Today, violent crime is down and mistreatment by the police and excessive incarceration have taken center stage in the minds of many younger voters. In 2013, nearly   of black men 18 to 34 reported being treated unfairly by the police in the previous 30 days, according to a Gallup survey. That has stirred anger among some young black people, which has crystallized in resentment of the Clintons in this election cycle. Charli Cleland, 24, a   student at Brooklyn Law School, said he planned to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders, even though his family has always admired the Clintons. “Growing up, there was always this idea that Bill Clinton was a man for people of color,” he said. “Then this political year comes around, and there is so much being exposed as to what they have said in the past and what kind of bills they have approved in the past. I’m realizing that it’s actually against everything that I initially thought about the Clintons. ” When he watched the exchange in Philadelphia, Mr. Cleland said he viewed Mr. Clinton and his remarks as “paternalistic” and “implicitly racist. ” The interviews with the younger voters reveal a pattern: Not only are they distrustful of the Clintons, but they also appear disillusioned with politics and institutions in a way their parents are not. And they are less interested in gaining approval, especially from white people. “We do not believe that freedom for black Americans will come through politicians,” said Erica Mines, an activist in Philadelphia who demonstrated at Mr. Clinton’s speech alongside Mr. Farmer. “We can no longer rely on the ballot box for our freedom. ” Older generations fought for civil rights “to be accepted into mainstream society,” she said. “But younger folks are saying, ‘I’m not going to fit into that box anymore, or allow society to tell me what I need to be. ’” Mr. Farmer said his mother, who put her faith in the ballot box, the church pulpit and the Clintons, initially found it hard to understand his brand of activism. “She just thinks in a way that is popular of a generation. Go in peace. March. Sing a hymn or two. Don’t do any fighting. Don’t do too much yelling,” said Mr. Farmer, a former Marine. Mr. Farmer and Ms. Mines joined a group called the Philly Coalition for REAL Justice, which believes that only disruptive, direct action can bring about change. On Thursday, members of the group blocked an intersection to push for a $15 minimum wage and other measures. Both he and Ms. Mines were arrested. Mr. Farmer says his mother’s views are changing as she watches his experience. “I was locked up for about 27 hours,” he said. “She was at the precinct when I came out. She gave the police an earful. ” And, in perhaps a more surprising shift, after hearing what Mr. Clinton said in Philadelphia, his mother has decided not to vote for Mrs. Clinton for president, Mr. Farmer said. “She was a Clinton fan,” he said. “She would have voted Clinton automatically. ”"
2997,2997,20609,"In Russian Doping Scandal, Time for a Punishment to Fit the Crime - The New York Times",New York Times,Michael Powell,2016-06-17,2016.0,6.0,,"You put the question to Sanya   a gold medal runner who has come back from so many injuries and who hopes to make another Olympic team before she retires. Would she let Russia, which carries about it the odor of   doping, into the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro? She shook her head. “You think about everything that happened, and how far up the chain it has gone there,” she said of Russia last month. “Missing the Olympics? For sure, that’s a reasonable punishment for the crime. ” The accumulating evidence of a   doping program filled with duplicity and evasion lay exposed to the sun. A Russian athlete, a former state official and even the director of Russia’s main drug testing laboratory say the world should not believe the results produced by Russian athletes, as illegal chemistry underlies them. The doping corruption begins at the highest reaches of the Ministry of Sport, they assert, and extends downward, accompanied by the suspicious deaths of two potential  . The good news is that the world’s best athletes are rising in revolt and demanding investigations. Nearly 600 British athletes, The Guardian reports, have called for a sweeping, worldwide investigation. American, European and Canadian skiers, swimmers and runners have added their insistent voices. The    news is that the regulatory bodies of world sports are like so many somnolent detective bureaus. The chiefs wag their heads and rummage through desks for musty reports and murmur, yes, yes, what a shame   …     Craig Reedie, the chief of the World   Agency, recently explained his regulatory approach to my colleague Rebecca Ruiz. “We’re not going to turn around to people and say: ‘These are the rules.’ If one of our stakeholders comes and says, ‘Can you advise us on how to proceed’? Then, clearly, we will advise them. ” I know Sir Craig is a knight and all that. So please, just this once, let him pull out his broad sword and slay a dragon. This week it’s the turn of another world body with a    record, the International Association of Athletics Federations. On Friday, the I. A. A. F. which governs track and field, will announce whether Russia and its athletes can participate in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. The I. A. A. F. is run by another knight, the former Olympic gold medal runner Lord Sebastian Coe. In 2015, Lord Coe, a longtime vice president in the organization, replaced Lamine Diack, who had served as president for 16 years. Soon after he left the I. A. A. F. Diack was arrested. He has been accused of taking many, many bribes to cover up positive doping tests by Russian athletes. Diack held a seat on the International Olympic Committee, as Sir Craig does currently. International sport is cozy. (Olympic reform is best pushed genteelly, not to mention gingerly honk too loudly about transgressions and your country might find its hopes of hosting an Olympics dashed.) WADA has taken a few important steps. Last year, its report uncovered systemic corruption in Russian track and field and pointed to many strands of corruption in winter sports. However, agency leaders resisted for many months calling in investigators to plunge down the necessary alleyways. All the while, the agency’s own athletes’ committee, and the heads of various national federations, pleaded for full investigations. Now my colleagues Ruiz, Juliet Macur and Ian Austen reported this week that WADA not only sat on detailed tips from Russian   but also passed along word of one such   to the same government officials accused of running the doping program. “You need to have proper, corroborated evidence in order to prove things,” Sir Craig said. “Secondly, we didn’t have powers under the old code to investigate. ” Both of his claims are baffling. WADA had, since 2010, two firsthand witnesses, a top athlete and a top official in the Russian antidoping agency, testifying to corruption in doping. Now there is another witness, Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the laboratory that handled the tests of thousands of Russian Olympians, and who described for The New York Times how he developed a powerful,   doping elixir. Rodchenkov sounds an awful lot like the Joe Valachi of Russian sports. (Valachi was the first great Mafia informer.) The good doctor estimated that by the end of the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, he and his work mates had expunged 100 dirty test results. Russian athletes won a splendid number of medals at those Winter Games. I’m no district attorney, but that strikes me as powerful firsthand testimony. As well, WADA was explicitly charged with monitoring code compliance by its signatories, which include Russia. In December 2014, the chief of the United States   Agency, Travis Tygart, wrote a tough,   private letter to WADA. He suggested that it strap on its police cap and badge and get to work. “Anything less than a full, complete and successful investigation by WADA   …     would constitute an abdication of WADA’s responsibilities,” he wrote in a letter also signed by the board chairman, Edwin Moses. “We do not believe that WADA lacks the power to conduct an investigation, protect witnesses or take steps” to investigate whether national agencies have become corrupted. Throat clearing is necessary here. Russian athletes are not uniquely fallen creatures. The list of American runners and bikers and skiers who have doped is long and desultory, although there is no evidence that this is  . The Salt Lake Winter Olympics in 2002 was a festival of bribes and doping. An Italian doctor was the Dr. Frankenstein of sports doping. The Finns had a major doping scandal a decade or so back. The Kenyan and Ethiopian   runners would be a heartwarming marvel were it not that so many keep getting nabbed by blood doping. Athletes everywhere face justifiable doubts. But that narrative coexists with a more hopeful one. Save for Russia and a few other nations, the battle against doping has taken many strides forward. Circumstantial evidence for this is found in the fact that in most disciplines, athletes no longer set records every few years. That was true during the 1980s and 1990s. (The    home run years in major league baseball offered a direct corollary, replete with complicity by the owners and rulers of that sport.) “It’s much harder to dope, and the advantage you can gain is less than it used to be,” notes Max Cobb, director of U. S. Biathlon and a longtime reformer in the arena of world sport. “  can take an athlete from 10th place to first place, but you’re no longer seeing those extraordinary, ‘Oh my God, how did that guy finish two minutes faster’ moments. ” The question now is what to do when a nation goes rogue and dedicates itself to systematically undermining doping regulations. The Russians under Vladimir Putin have lashed their national pride to the mast of athletic achievement. Russia is a global superpower, and not easily sent stomping to its room. But even the latest interim report from WADA this week gives not much cause for hope. A large number of athletes continue to evade tests, and when asked their whereabouts, as is required of every athlete worldwide so that drug testers can find them, a striking number of Russian athletes list   “military cities. ” Testing officers need special permission to enter these cities, which delays and in some cases prevents testing. When in Eugene, Ore. last month, I talked about this with the American runner  . “I’m literally tested at least two times a week,” she said. “At least. I’m happy to live up to those standards. I just want that standard to be the same all around the world, including Russia. ” That seems a reasonable request. On Friday, we’ll see if the cops of sport are up to the task of walking their beat."
4320,4320,22080,"Marijuana Arrests Outnumber Those for Violent Crimes, Study Finds - The New York Times",New York Times,Timothy Williams,2016-10-18,2016.0,10.0,,"Arrests for possessing small amounts of marijuana exceeded those for all violent crimes last year, a new study has found, even as social attitudes toward the drug have changed and a number of cities and states have legalized its use or decriminalized small quantities. And a disproportionate number of those arrested are   who smoke marijuana at rates similar to whites but are arrested and prosecuted far more often for having small amounts for personal use, according to the study. The arrests can overwhelm court systems. Dianne Jones, 45, who was arrested in New Orleans in 2014 on charges of having a small bag of marijuana, spent 10 days in jail because she could not put up a $2, 500 bond. She was able to get enough money together only after her daughter sold the family’s television set at a pawnshop for $200. Later, when Ms. Jones, who is   was unable to pay   fees and fines, a judge issued a warrant for her arrest. With marijuana use on the rise, law enforcement agencies made 574, 641 arrests last year for small quantities of the drug intended for personal use, according to the report, which was released Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights Watch. The marijuana arrests were about 13. 6 percent more than the 505, 681 arrests made for all violent crimes, including murder, rape and serious assaults. The report comes in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott last month in Charlotte, N. C. Mr. Scott, 43, had attracted police attention in part because, the police said, he was smoking marijuana. The report is the latest study to highlight the disparate treatment   often receive in the criminal justice system, including disproportionate numbers of blacks who are sent to jail when they are unable to pay   fees, or stopped by the police during traffic stops or while riding bicycles. People arrested for marijuana possession or other minor crimes often have a more difficult time finding work, including Cory, 31, who declined to give his last name out of concern his comments could affect his parole. He said in an interview that he had failed to find a job after 14 months in a Louisiana prison for his fifth offense involving a small quantity of drugs. He said he had been turned down by a   restaurant because of his marijuana conviction, as well as at the restaurant where he worked before his last arrest as a fry cook and dishwasher. “I’ve kind of stopped trying,” said Cory, who is  . Tess Borden, a fellow at Human Rights Watch and the A. C. L. U. who wrote the report, found that despite the steep decline in crime rates over the last two decades  —   including a 36 percent drop in violent crime arrests from 1995 to 2015  —   the number of arrests for all drug possessions, including marijuana, increased 13 percent. The emphasis on making marijuana arrests is worrisome, Ms. Borden said. “Most people don’t think drug possession is the No. 1 public safety concern, but that’s what we’re seeing,” she said. Criminologists say that   are arrested more often than whites and others for drug possession in large part because of questionable police practices. Police departments, for example, typically send large numbers of officers to neighborhoods that have high crime rates. A result is that any offense  —   including minor ones like loitering, jaywalking or smoking marijuana  —   can lead to an arrest, which in turn drives up arrest rate statistics, leading to even greater police vigilance. “It is selective enforcement, and the example I like to use is that you have all sorts of drug use inside elite college dorms, but you don’t see the police busting through doors,” said Inimai M. Chettiar, director of the Justice Program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.   may also be more apt to face arrest, according to researchers, because they might be more likely to smoke marijuana outdoors, attracting the attention of the police. The report, which advocates the decriminalization of small quantities of illegal drugs intended for personal use, found that while whites are more likely than blacks to use illicit drugs  —   including marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and prescription drugs for nonmedical purposes  —   black adults were more than     times as likely to be arrested. In terms of marijuana possession, black adults were more than four times as likely to be arrested as white adults in the 39 states in which sufficient data was available, according to the report. The disparities, the analysis found, persist whether there are few or many   in a given area. In Iowa, Montana and Vermont  —   places with relatively small populations of    —   blacks were more than six times as likely to be arrested on drug possession charges than whites. In Manhattan, where blacks make up about 15 percent of the population,   are nearly 11 times as likely as whites to be arrested on drug possession, according to the report. Ms. Jones, who was arrested in New Orleans with a $10 bag of marijuana, said the warrant for her arrests had been dismissed only after a community group for which she is a volunteer raised the remaining $155 of the $834 she owed the court. “What happened to me shouldn’t happen to anybody,” she said."

The attack, which unfolded over the span of about three minutes and a   stretch of road in Richmond, Calif. on Sept. 25, started by chance, officials said. Five men who were doing subcontracting work at a refinery were staying at a local hotel and had been drinking beer most of the day when they went to get something to eat, Simon O’Connell, a deputy district attorney with the Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office, said in an interview on Friday. The men were in a pickup around 8:45 p. m. when they pulled up to a red traffic light next to a sedan driven by Maan S. Khalsa, 41, of Richmond. In what Mr. O’Connell said was an unprovoked act, the occupants threw beer cans at Mr. Khalsa’s car. When he rolled down his window and said, “You guys forgot something,” the men, angered by his remark, followed him to the next red light. Two of the men  —   identified as Chase B. Little, 31, of Beaumont, Tex. and Colton T. Leblanc, 24, of Winnie, Tex.  —   ran to Mr. Khalsa’s car and repeatedly punched him in the face through the open driver’s window, officials said. A turban Mr. Khalsa was wearing as part of his Sikh religion was disturbed in the attack, during which the men forced his head down and cut up to 10 inches of his hair with a knife, prosecutors said. “The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsa’s unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law,” the prosecutor’s office said in a news release. Mr. Little, who was taken into custody at the scene, was charged with assault and released that night on bail. He is to appear in court on Nov. 21. A warrant for Mr. Leblanc, who left the scene, has been issued, officials said. The other occupants of the pickup were not charged. Mr. Little and Mr. Leblanc were both charged with assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury and assault with a deadly weapon, with the “special allegation” that they were committed as hate crimes. With that enhancement, they could face a maximum of 11 years in prison, Mr. O’Connell said. It was not clear if Mr. Little had a lawyer, and neither man could be reached to comment on Friday. In a statement released through the Sikh Coalition, Mr. Khalsa said he was “violently targeted” because of his faith. “The charges are the first step to addressing violence and bigotry, which plague communities across the United States,” he said. Mr. Khalsa, an information technology specialist, had a black eye, numerous damaged teeth and several knife wounds to his left hand. His little finger will be amputated at the first knuckle because of an infection from the knife wound, officials said."
5566,5566,23528,France Says Truck Attacker Was Tunisia Native With Record of Petty Crime - The New York Times,New York Times,"Alissa J. Rubin, Lilia Blaise, Adam Nossiter and Aurelien Breeden",2017-01-19,2017.0,1.0,,"NICE, France  —   French officials on Friday identified the man who used a   truck to massacre dozens of people on the French Riviera as a    native of Tunisia with a history of petty crime and marriage problems  —   but no links with the militant extremists who have targeted and traumatized France. The rampage Thursday night at a packed Bastille Day fireworks celebration in the southeastern city of Nice, which unfolded as the assailant used the rented refrigerated truck as a battering ram, was all the more unnerving because it came as a total surprise despite extensive security precautions, French officials acknowledged. Nearly 24 hours later there was no claim of responsibility, and the Paris prosecutor, François Molins, said the killer, whom he identified as Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel, had been “completely unknown by intelligence services. ” Mr. Molins said the toll rose on Friday to 84 dead and 202 injured. At least 10 of the dead were children or teenagers, enjoying a fireworks display one moment and crushed to death the next. It was the third major terrorist assault in 19 months to strike France, which has been singled out by militant extremist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. “We will not give in to the terrorist threat,” Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Friday morning after a cabinet meeting led by President François Hollande. But Mr. Valls also offered a grim observation for his countrymen: “The times have changed, and France is going to have to live with terrorism. ” Starting around 10:45 p. m. Thursday, the attacker mowed down scores of victims before dying in a gunfight with three police officers, who pursued him down the Promenade des Anglais, a storied seaside boulevard. The police searched two locations in Nice on Friday, including a home with Mr. Bouhlel’s name outside it, and workers in   suits searched a truck smaller than the one used in the attack. His   was held for questioning. Although neither the Islamic State or Al Qaeda asserted any role, online accounts associated with the groups welcomed the massacre. Mr. Bouhlel was born on Jan. 3, 1985, and raised in Msaken, a town in northeastern Tunisia, Mr. Molins said. He had a history of petty crime, including theft, going back to 2010, and he received a   suspended sentence in March for assaulting a driver during an altercation in January. “However, he is completely unknown by intelligence services, both at the national and local levels,” Mr. Molins said. “He has never been in any database or been flagged for radicalization. ” Mr. Bouhlel rented the truck on Monday in     about six miles west of Nice, and then parked it in the Auriol neighborhood of eastern Nice. At 9:34 p. m. on Thursday, according to surveillance footage, Mr. Bouhlel bicycled to the truck and drove it westward, arriving at 10:30 in the Magnan neighborhood, north of the Promenade des Anglais. He drove into the crowd, heading east on the promenade, around 15 minutes later. Mr. Bouhlel initially crushed two people and then drove 1. 1 miles east, running over people left and right. Outside the Negresco Hotel, Mr. Bouhlel fired at three police officers who fired back, then pursued him for about a thousand feet. They killed him outside a Hyatt hotel and casino. Mr. Bouhlel was found dead in the passenger seat. In the truck’s cabin, police found an automatic 7.  pistol, a cartridge clip, and several cartridges. They also found a fake automatic pistol two fake assault rifles, a Kalashnikov and an   a nonfunctioning grenade and a mobile phone and documents. Among the dead were two German students and their teacher two Americans two Tunisians, and one Russian. Of the 202 people wounded, 52 had serious injuries and 25 were in intensive care, Mr. Molins said. Officials canceled festivities in Nice, a city of 340, 000, including a   jazz festival and a concert on Friday night by Rihanna. “There are many children, young children who had come to watch fireworks with their family, to have joy, to share happiness, delight, amazement, and who were struck, struck to death, merely to satisfy the cruelty of an individual  —   and maybe of a group,” said Mr. Hollande, flanked by Mr. Valls and Health Minister Marisol Touraine, after meeting with victims and medical workers at the Pasteur Hospital in Nice. Mr. Hollande said the victims were physically and psychologically scarred. “Many told me that they had no recollection of what might have caused their wounds,” he said. “However, they remember the bodies that were torn to shreds right in front of their eyes. ” Despite mounting  criticism over France’s efforts to prevent terrorism attacks, Mr. Hollande praised French security forces, saying they had “taken all necessary measures so that this fireworks show might be as protected as possible  —   as had been the case during the European Championship soccer tournament. ” “Why Nice?” Mr. Hollande asked. “Because it is a city that is known worldwide, one of the most beautiful cities on the planet. Why on the 14th of July? Because it is a celebration of freedom. It was, therefore, indeed to affect France that the individual committed this terrorist attack. ” Hours before the carnage, Mr. Hollande had said that a state of emergency put in place after the Nov. 13 attacks in and around Paris would end soon. The government will now seek to extend the state of emergency for three months. As France announced three days of national mourning, starting on Saturday, world leaders  —   including Pope Francis, President Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Britain’s new prime minister, Theresa May  —   expressed sympathy and outrage. It was a sadly familiar ritual for France, where a total of 147 people were killed in terrorist attacks in and around Paris in January and November of last year, and it raised new questions throughout the world about the ability of extremists to sow terror. The internet reverberated with calls for prayer for victims of attacks in Brussels Istanbul Orlando, Fla. Baghdad and other cities struck by mass terrorism attributed to Islamist extremists this year. “The horror, the horror has, once again, hit France,” Mr. Hollande told the nation early Friday morning before leaving for Nice. “France has been struck on the day of her national holiday,” he said. “Human rights are denied by fanatics, and France is clearly their target. ” The attacks could add to the political problems facing Mr. Hollande, who is expected to seek a second   term next year even though he is deeply unpopular. On Friday, criticisms of the government’s seeming inability to prevent attacks began to emerge. Alain Juppé, a former prime minister and one of the main candidates in the   primary for next year’s presidential election, told RTL radio Friday morning, “If all the means had been taken, this tragedy would not have occurred. ” Mr. Juppé called for better coordination among France’s intelligence agencies, as a parliamentary inquiry recommended this month. Georges Fenech, a   lawmaker who presided over the parliamentary inquiry, said on Twitter early Friday that the attack was a “predictable tragedy. ” “I don’t want to hear about national unity,” Mr. Fenech told the news channel iTélé. “Today, it is a duty to talk to the French people, to tell them that our country is not equipped against Islamist terrorism. ” Christian Estrosi, the president of the    d’Azur region, which includes Nice, expressed outrage, sympathy and frustration in an interview with   on Friday morning, pointedly noting the attacks in France last year, as well as the ones in March in Brussels. “Questions are raised,” he said. “As I try to comfort the families, I also try to contain my anger. I can’t hide to you that I feel a deep anger. How is it possible in our country that after everyone said there was a state of emergency, a state of war, we forget it, after Charlie Hebdo and the Bataclan? After the Bataclan, we forgot, and there was Brussels. After Brussels, we forgot, and there was Nice, so there are questions that need to be answered. ” Witnesses to the Nice attack described scenes of mayhem. “We were enjoying the celebrations when we suddenly saw people running everywhere and tables being pushed down by the movement of panic,” said Daphné Burandé, 15, who was at a bar near the beach to watch the fireworks. “No one explained to us what was happening, and I heard some gunshots not very far away,” she said. “I waited at the bar for more information because I thought it was a false alert. But then, people were still running. ” Another witness, Raja   43, said the attack seemed, at first, as if it might have been the act of a drunken driver. “There was a white truck that was advancing slowly,” Ms. Kamel said. “Then it started to plow into the crowd, zigzagging and crushing people. I could not believe it. ”"
6390,6390,24652,"After a Crime, the Price of a Second Chance - The New York Times",New York Times,Shaila Dewan and Andrew W. Lehren,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,,"During the tough financial times of 2011, Marcy Willis, a single mother who raised five children in Atlanta, used her credit card to rent a car for an acquaintance in exchange for cash. But the man  —   and the car  —   disappeared, she said. Four months later, when Ms. Willis finally recovered the car and returned it, she was charged with felony theft. As a   offender, Ms. Willis, 52, qualified for a big break: a program called pretrial intervention, also known as diversion. If she took 12 weeks of classes, performed 24 hours of community service and stayed out of trouble, her case would be dismissed and her arrest could be expunged, leaving her record clean. Diversion is not uncommon. Last year, Rebecca Horting, a    nurse in Topeka, Kan. was offered a similar deal for an offense that caused far greater harm. She was charged with reckless battery and texting while driving after she hit a girl on a bicycle, causing brain damage and the loss of a leg. Both women did what was required of them, yet their cases took different paths. The reason: money. Ms. Horting was able to pay $1, 138 in fees and is on track to have her case dismissed. Ms. Willis, who owed $690, had a harder time. When she paid all but $240, her case was sent back to court for prosecution. By that time, the arrest had already led to her losing her job, and then her apartment. At a homeless shelter, she was robbed. Accustomed to earning a living, she began to despair. “I felt like I was in a grave or a hole and instead of digging the dirt out, it was piling up,” Ms. Willis said. “I lost the respect of my kids, my family, and I was too embarrassed to reach out to friends  —   so what do you do?” Though few people have heard of diversion, the practice is increasingly being embraced as a way for the criminal justice system to save people from itself. Diversion is intended to relieve overburdened courts and crowded jails, and to spare   offenders from the devastating consequences of a criminal record. It mostly applies to nonviolent cases that make up the vast majority of crimes  —   offenses like shoplifting, drug possession and theft. There are now diversion programs in almost every state. But an examination by The New York Times found that in many places, only people with money could afford a second chance. Though diversion was introduced as a   reform, some jurisdictions quickly turned it into a source of revenue. Prosecutors exert almost total control over diversion, deciding who deserves mercy and at what price, The Times found. The prosecutors who grant diversion often benefit directly from the fees, which vary widely from town to town and can reach $5, 000 for a single offense. In a country where 27 million households make less than $25, 000 a year, even $500 can be prohibitive. Diversion, interviews and case records show, can be revoked for failure to pay, or never even offered to defendants deemed too poor to afford it. A prosecutor in Ohio said he rejected applicants if he thought they wouldn’t be able to pay restitution within a time limit  —   one that he imposed. “To tell somebody that if you can pay for this, you can get your charges dismissed, but if you are poor you are going to go through the system? That’s completely unfair,” said Mark Kammerer, who runs diversion programs for the Cook County state’s attorney in Chicago, where defendants are not charged a fee. The Times examination focused on adult diversion programs run by prosecutors, as opposed to drug courts or mental health courts where a judge is in charge. The Times gathered information, statutes and fee schedules on 225 diversion programs in 37 states and interviewed more than 150 prosecutors, defense lawyers, defendants and experts. Because prosecutors have wide latitude to design the programs, different jurisdictions have different rules, resulting in substantial inequities for defendants, records and interviews show. Tennesseans cannot get diversion for drunken driving, but in Oregon it is common. In Saline County, Kan. diversion is not offered for drug offenses three counties south, it is. In Toms River, N. J. a school district official accused of a $141 fraud was rejected by the prosecutor, who argued that she had violated the public trust. But near   N. C. a prosecutor accused of offering $20, 000 to fix an election was allowed to enter pretrial diversion. Because diversion is considered a privilege, not a right, the district attorney’s decision is almost always final and those who are rejected have no way to appeal. Yet even defendants who are granted diversion can discover that the central promise of the program  —   avoiding prosecution and a criminal record  —   can be an empty one. Dismissed cases can still show up as a black mark in a background check. And many district attorneys impose rules that undermine the benefits of diversion, such as requiring defendants to enter a guilty plea that can later be used against them. Some defendants find themselves saddled with strict requirements, like hundreds of hours of community service, five years of probation or even a month in jail, that are indistinguishable from punishment. Because prosecutors are usually not required to report on their programs and many diversion agreements are not filed in court, there is little quantifiable data on fees, success rates, recidivism or even who is rejected. A few studies, including a recent Department of Justice examination of the Memphis juvenile court system, suggest that whites are far more likely to get diversion than blacks. Almost 200 defense lawyers across the country answered a Times questionnaire about diversion.   of them said fees were a barrier for their clients. In Atlanta, Ms. Willis’s diversion was overseen by a private company that said about one in four of its cases was returned to court, often for failure to pay. Because of a court backlog, Ms. Willis’s case remained pending, and on her record, for more than four years. Finally, in January, she scraped together the remaining $240 and, with the help of the Georgia Justice Project, got the case dismissed. Now, her record has been approved for expungement  —   as soon as she can pay the $25 fee. In the aging rust belt towns of Lorain County, Ohio, diversion operates under the sole authority of Dennis Will, the prosecuting attorney. Mr. Will allows arresting officers and victims to block diversion. Defendants who enter the program pay only a modest fee but must plead guilty and pay off all restitution within a year. Though state law allows diversion for violent offenders in certain circumstances, Mr. Will does not. Lawyers there said diversion applicants had been denied because of unrelated prior offenses like driving with a suspended license or drunken driving. “It was very difficult to get anybody in diversion,” said one local lawyer, Kenneth Ortner. “It was a joke among defense attorneys. ” A national panel had something else in mind when it drew up standards in 2008 for pretrial diversion. The programs had been around for decades, but fell out of favor during the war on drugs. With the tide turning against incarceration, the idea was to reintroduce diversion as an alternative, said Spurgeon Kennedy, the vice president of the National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies, which drafted the standards. Diversion is intended to address the root causes of crime by connecting defendants to counseling, job training and, in the case of a Philadelphia man caught with painkillers, medical benefits to cover a   root canal. It also gives prosecutors a   way to avoid absurd outcomes. A Georgia college student who hacked into the online calendar of the school’s football rival and left a prank message faced up to 15 years in prison. He got diversion instead. Brendan Kelly, a prosecutor in Illinois, started offering diversion four years ago after seeing marijuana arrests having “tremendous impact” on the future of young   men. “You’re branding them with a scarlet F” for felon, Mr. Kelly said. “You’re making them a permanent problem for law enforcement. ” But diversion is not without political risk, and it requires officials to balance questions of culpability, justice and mercy. In Chattanooga, Tenn. there was a public outcry when a speeding teenager was given diversion after a fatal crash. In San Antonio, on the other hand, a district attorney reluctant to use diversion was unseated. In Lorain County, Mr. Will said, voters have the ultimate say. “If people don’t like the decisions I make, then they have a way to deal with that. ” Frustrated by Mr. Will’s rules, county judges decided to take the matter into their own hands. In 2010, they started a competing program. James Burge, a judge at the time, said the legislature had intended for many more defendants to get diversion. “You find a credit card on the ground and you use it. That’s an automatic felony. You come in to Judge Burge and you plead guilty. You’re going to be on probation for at least 18 months and you’re going to have a felony conviction,” Mr. Burge said. “You have to wait another three years to get that record sealed. That’s four to five years as a young adult with a felony record. Try to buy a car, get a job, get a loan  —   it’s not happening. ” The judges’ diversion program gave a second chance to some defendants who had been rejected by Mr. Will. Among them was Wayne Dopart, who had been indicted on theft and Medicaid fraud charges. Mr. Will did not believe that Mr. Dopart could pay the thousands of dollars he owed in the case within a year, his lawyer recalled. But when Mr. Dopart was admitted to the judges’ program, he paid on time. Brenda   who was charged with theft, was denied diversion because her arresting officer objected, according to court records. Corey Earl, a former police officer accused of cashing a $400 stolen check shortly after retiring from the force, was also deemed ineligible. Both Ms.   and Mr. Earl successfully completed the judges’ diversion program. Of the 21 defendants listed in one court filing who had been granted diversion by the judges, only two had subsequent charges in Lorain County. But defendants like Ms.   and Mr. Earl were not in the clear. Instead, they found themselves ensnared in a legal battle between the judges and the prosecutor. Mr. Will argued repeatedly to the appeals court that only prosecutors had the power to grant diversion. Several of the judges’ completed diversion cases were overturned and the defendants were forced to return to court. Ms.   pleaded guilty and now has a felony record. Mr. Earl’s diversion was upheld, but he has been unable to get the case expunged from his record so he can find work. Mr. Will argued that because Mr. Earl was a police officer, “it is important for the public to maintain a public record of when this public figure admitted to violating that trust. ” Early last year,    Caleb Moore was arrested in Troy, Ala. on charges of possessing Xanax and marijuana. Mr. Moore is the son of Roy Moore, at the time the chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. Despite having three prior   arrests, Caleb Moore was granted pretrial diversion, paying $900. After he promised to enter drug rehab, his case was dismissed. But not every defendant is the son of a prominent jurist. The vast majority are poor people for whom $900 is well out of reach. Yet in many jurisdictions, they are required to pay the same fees as   defendants. Diversion programs have complex fee structures, and it is impossible to come up with an average cost. To begin with, some defendants must pay just to find out whether they are eligible The Times found nonrefundable application fees as high as $250. If accepted, defendants almost always pay a program fee, typically a few hundred dollars but in some places far higher. Drunken driving diversion is often the most expensive in the city of Dothan, Ala. it costs up to $5, 000. The list of additional charges can be long: counseling, classes, drug tests, monthly supervision, charitable contributions, court costs, prosecution costs and compensation for the arresting agency. The Times found cases where defendants who were not being prosecuted paid a $400 drug lab fee, a $50 Crime Stoppers fee or $2, 000 for the services of an indigent defense lawyer. District attorneys are sometimes willing to adjust their diversion policies for the right price. In Shawnee County, Kan. defendants who might not normally be considered eligible can get diversion if they agree to pay more than the usual fee  —   sometimes thousands of dollars more  —   said Matt Patterson, the district attorney’s chief of staff. Asked if the fees are ever waived for the poor, Mr. Patterson gave a long sigh. “Not really, to be honest with you,” he said. The same is true in many places. “Pretrial diversion is a voluntary program,” reads the prosecutor’s website in Florida’s 18th judicial circuit, in all capital letters. “Fees are not eligible for reduction or waiver. ” While some jurisdictions do make allowances for the poor, The Times found sliding scales that exist largely in theory. In South Carolina, state lawmakers capped the diversion fee at $350 and said it might be waived for indigent defendants. But waivers remain an afterthought at best. In a review of diversion guidelines issued by 13 of the state’s 16 prosecutors, only two mentioned the possibility of a waiver. In interviews, several prosecutors seemed to have given little consideration to whether the costs exclude defendants. “I guess you’re right,” said Ron Dixon, a longtime prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga. when asked if fees kept people out of the program. Scott Colom, who last year was elected district attorney in eastern Mississippi with help from the liberal billionaire George Soros, said he ran on a platform of expanding diversion but kept the fee the same as his predecessor, assuming it was cheap compared with other places. It is $1, 320. That fee does cover services that cost extra in other jurisdictions, like drug testing and counseling. It can also be paid over time, which makes diversion more accessible. It is impossible to determine how many defendants are barred from diversion for lack of money, but one jurisdiction offers a hint. The diversion program in New Orleans once cost as much as $1, 200 and had about 300 participants. In 2009, when a new district attorney lowered the cost to $200, participation more than tripled. But some jurisdictions have come to rely on diversion revenue. In 2015, Wichita, Kan. brought in almost $1. 2 million, an increase of 49 percent over 2010. Diversion fees have received little scrutiny: They are rarely challenged in court, and district attorneys are seldom required to give a detailed account of how they spend the money. With so few checks and balances, the money can easily become a source of temptation. In 2013, a Nebraska prosecutor pleaded guilty to donating diversion money to a trapshooting team. In 2009, the district attorney in Shawnee County was found to have paid himself more than $300, 000 from the pretrial diversion and forfeiture funds. The county attorney in Brown County, Tex. is under investigation for accepting what he called donations of as much as $2, 500  —   the state maximum diversion fee is $500  —   in exchange for diversion. Some critics say diversion fees do not pass the smell test no matter how the money is used. “It’s almost like you’re paying for a dismissal,” said Lynn Pride Richardson, the chief public defender in Dallas. “And that is illegal. ” Some prosecutors said fees were necessary to cover programs’ costs. In other cases, defendants were used as piggy banks. Scott Anderson, who worked in the Topeka city prosecutor’s office, said the city’s fee structure had pure revenue “built in,” even though the program saved the city money. “The way we explained it to defendants  —   this is going to sound terrible  —   it was the benefit of the bargain for us: what the city was getting for not prosecuting you,” said Mr. Anderson, who has since become a public defender in Wichita. “When I was a prosecutor, it didn’t present a problem to me. But I’ve been a defense attorney now for 11 months, and it’s been an ” Mr. Anderson said. “I didn’t realize how many people we were actually disenfranchising from participating. ” By title, Amrith Aakre is an assistant prosecutor in Cook County, which encompasses Chicago. But what she really does is save people from prosecution. One morning in June, she sorted paperwork from the previous night’s arrests into two stacks: eligible for diversion, or probably not. A sheaf of paperwork from a huge drug bust went into the “no” pile. But on other cases, Ms. Aakre paused to take a closer look. She picked up one case, a car  . “You see   damage like shattering windows, a violent component,” she said. “We’re looking at the public safety risk. This happened across the street from a school at 12 o’clock, when all the kids were outside at recess. ” Next, she checked the defendant’s history. “We’re looking for a pattern  —   is this a   thing or is there a long pattern of violence? If it’s a   thing, this may be the gateway. There is a saying, ‘The more you do it, the more you do it.’ And this is our opportunity to catch them at an early stage and give them the services to cope with whatever they’re dealing with. ” Cook County’s diversion programs, recognized as a national model, handle about 5, 000 defendants a year. The emphasis is on inclusion: A team of prosecutors like Ms. Aakre is dedicated to scouting potential cases, and eligibility has steadily expanded. Defendants do not have to plead guilty if they fail, they are either returned for traditional prosecution with no penalty or moved to a more intensive program. Diversion can be completed quickly, in as little as three months for the most minor offenses. Victims must give consent, but they rarely refuse, prosecutors said. Defendants pay no fee  —   in fact, the notion strikes prosecutors as absurd. “That would be a complete failure here in Cook County,” said Robert Groebner Jr. a felony prosecutor. “These defendants, they don’t have $50 in their pocket. ” The wide range of diversion programs is based on a medical model: Use the least invasive treatment that has a chance of success. Misdemeanor defendants may be required to do nothing more than attend two counseling sessions, while those charged with felonies can be sent to Branch 9, a yearlong program overseen by a singing,     judge. Community service is assigned only if the defendant cannot find a job. In part because relapse is often part of recovery from addiction, the programs are forgiving: Defendants can repeat drug school, a defensive   class for   drug offenders, if they have been   for three years, and can undergo a more intensive drug diversion program up to three times. Participants may be asked to get a substance abuse evaluation, but treatment is not mandatory. “These are not people who are acutely symptomatic,” said Mark Kammerer, who runs the programs. “These are people who we want to think about whether there’s something deeper going on with them. ” More complex cases are referred to drug court or mental health court, where defendants can be required to get treatment. By Mr. Kammerer’s measure, the programs are highly successful. A year after finishing felony diversion, 97 percent of graduates have no new felony arrests, and 86 percent have no new arrests of any kind. Drug school alone saves the county an estimated $1. 5 million a year. One afternoon in felony court, Debra Kreatsoulas anxiously awaited the appearance of her husband, Carlos Ramirez. Mr. Ramirez had gone to work drunk, Ms. Kreatsoulas said, and had gotten into an argument with a fellow school custodian. Mr. Ramirez left, saying he was going to get a gun and shoot the other man, according to the police report. It was the day after a mass shooting at an Orlando, Fla. nightclub that killed 49 people. The school was placed on lockdown the story made the evening news. Mr. Ramirez might have faced up to three years in prison. But when prosecutors reviewed the facts  —   he had no criminal record and no gun was found  —   they decided that diversion was more appropriate. The victim at first refused to allow diversion, saying that Mr. Ramirez had used a racial slur. But he relented when he learned that Mr. Ramirez had already spent more than two weeks in jail. Ms. Kreatsoulas, a teacher’s aide who could not afford to bail her husband out, was optimistic. She said his drinking had become worse since he lost a   job a year before. “This might force him to get the help that he needs,” she said. “He has a family that he needs to stand up and start supporting. ” Mr. Ramirez accepted Branch 9 diversion and, hours later, was released from jail, which he described as a dangerous place where inmates fought over bread and soap. “I’m not coming back here to the jungle,” he said. Branch 9 connects defendants to services like classes for a high school equivalency diploma, substance abuse evaluations and health insurance. Spurgeon Kennedy, the diversion expert, said recent research contradicted the assumption that punitive rules and negative consequences, rather than immediate benefits, keep defendants in line. “Defendants don’t think that way,” he said. “Most people are participating because they see a value. ” So far, Mr. Kammerer said, Mr. Ramirez has met all of his diversion requirements and is once again working full time. Ten years ago, Issa Kona tried to steal an $80 battery charger from a Home Depot in Cleveland. The prosecutor’s office charged him with robbery, as opposed to shoplifting, because store employees said that when they asked for the merchandise, Mr. Kona resisted and had to be handcuffed. Still, it was his first arrest. Mr. Kona’s case was dismissed after he agreed to plead guilty and enter pretrial diversion. He came to regret it. Mr. Kona, a Palestinian stonecutter, has been in the United States legally since 2002. His three daughters are in college. He had applied to become a United States citizen. But when immigration lawyers discovered his robbery case, they warned him that the fact that he had pleaded guilty meant he could be deported. “We don’t want to go back,” Mr. Kona said. “We don’t know a thing back there. ” Diversion’s big promise is to spare defendants a criminal record. But that central goal is being undermined by prosecutors across the country who, for the sake of expediency, are requiring defendants like Mr. Kona to plead guilty. If a defendant fails to complete diversion and is sent back to court, prosecutors must mount a case from scratch, locating evidence and witnesses months or years after the fact. “You didn’t just go to a sentencing hearing, you went to square zero,” said Joshua Marquis, an Oregon district attorney who serves on the board of the National District Attorneys Association. “So many D. A. s were like, ‘Why are we doing this? ’” Guilty pleas solve the problem, ensuring conviction without the effort of a trial. But for defendants, the pleas make things more difficult, coming back to haunt them years after completing diversion. Pleas have been used as evidence to deny professional licenses, citizenship and employment. The 2008 diversion guidelines issued by the National Association of Pretrial Services Agencies said that defendants should not be required to plead guilty. Other common practices make it harder for defendants to succeed. Though prosecutors can dismiss a case when diversion starts, clearing it from the docket with the option of reopening it later, many prefer to leave the case open. A pending charge, though, can stymie defendants’ efforts to find work and housing, or even win custody of their children. The guidelines also stressed that dismissal is not enough  —   after diversion, cases should be sealed or expunged from the public record. But expungement is rarely automatic, and many defendants do not realize that it requires filing paperwork and paying an additional fee. In El Paso, the district attorney bans expungement altogether. In interviews, several defendants said they had trouble landing a job because their case appeared in background checks. Employers, they said, did not differentiate between a dismissal and a conviction. In some cases, even expungement may not be enough. Though state laws usually specify that sealed records do not have to be disclosed on applications, The Times found job, college and housing forms that ask applicants whether they have ever had a case diverted. The application for St. Mary’s University School of Law in San Antonio requires people to disclose any criminal case, “even if you were granted any type of pretrial diversion. ” It adds, “Disclosure is required even if you have been told by any source that you do not have to disclose any such instance. ” Stephen M. Sheppard, dean of the law school, said diversion would not disqualify an applicant. The point, he said, was evoking candor and making sure that students did not have unacknowledged problems like substance abuse that would hinder them from representing future clients. In Cleveland, Mr. Kona tried to undo his diversion and guilty plea to clear his path to citizenship. Had the case gone to trial, Mr. Kona’s lawyer said, it would most likely have been downgraded to the less serious charge of shoplifting, which would not set off deportation. So Mr. Kona took the unusual step of asking the state Supreme Court to allow him to be prosecuted. During oral arguments 18 months ago, Justice William O’Neill did not bother to suppress his incredulity. “In order to get into that diversion program, you must admit to committing a crime?” he asked. “What happened to the Fifth Amendment?” Last month, the court finally ruled, in Mr. Kona’s favor. The local prosecutor announced that he would not retry the case."
6593,6593,24917,Report Accuses Mexico of Crimes Against Humanity in Drug War - The New York Times,New York Times,Elisabeth Malkin,2016-06-06,2016.0,6.0,,"MEXICO CITY  —   Two days after Jorge Antonio Parral Rabadán was kidnapped by a criminal gang, the Mexican Army raided the remote ranch where he was a prisoner and killed him. As he instinctively raised his hands in defense, the soldiers fired over and over at   range. A brief army communiqué about the event asserted that soldiers had returned fire and killed three hit men at the El Puerto ranch on April 26, 2010. But Mr. Parral had fired no weapon. He was a government employee, the supervisor of a bridge crossing into Texas, when he and a customs agent were abducted, according to a 2013 investigation by the National Human Rights Commission. The case, which is still open, has volleyed among prosecutors, yet his parents persist, determined that someone be held accountable. “Tell me if this looks like the face of a killer to you,” said Alicia Rabadán Sánchez, Mr. Parral’s mother, pulling a photograph of a happy young man from a plastic folder. In the years since the Mexican government began an intense military campaign against drug gangs, many stories like Mr. Parral’s have surfaced  —   accounts of people caught at the intersection of organized crime, security forces and a failing justice system. They are killed at military checkpoints, vanish inside navy facilities or are tortured by federal police officers. Seldom are their cases investigated. A trial and conviction are even more rare. But are these cases just regrettable accidents in the course of a   government battle against drug violence? A new report by the Open Society Justice Initiative, which works on criminal justice reforms around the world, argues that they are not. Instead, the study says, they point to a pattern of indiscriminate force and impunity that is an integral part of the state’s policy. And in the framework of international law, the study argues, the killings, forced disappearances and torture constitute crimes against humanity. The evidence is “overwhelming,” said James A. Goldston, the executive director of the New   Justice Initiative, which will release the report on Tuesday. “In case after case, army actors and federal police have been implicated. ” But in all but a few cases, the allegations languish, are dismissed or are reclassified. “The impunity is a loud signal that crimes against humanity are being committed,” Mr. Goldston said. The Justice Initiative report is the first time an international group has made a public legal argument that the pattern of abuses amounts to crimes against humanity. The finding is significant, Mr. Goldston said, because under the lens of international law, an investigation would seek to determine the chain of command behind the policy. The government of President Enrique Peña Nieto rejected the conclusions. “Based on international law, crimes against humanity are generalized or systematic attacks against a civilian population which are committed in accordance with a state policy,” the government said in a statement. “In Mexico the immense majority of violent crimes have been committed by criminal organizations. ” The report does not dispute that last point. Its analysis, which covers the   administration of former President Felipe Calderón and the first three years of Mr. Peña Nieto’s government, also looks at the Zetas, the most violent of Mexico’s drug gangs. Their brutal actions constitute crimes against humanity as well, the report concludes. The government said that in the “exceptional cases” in which public officials have been shown to be involved in the use of excessive force, human rights abuses or torture, they have been tried and sentenced. But human rights and international organizations have argued for years that these cases are not exceptional. Rather than ask the International Criminal Court to begin an investigation, the Justice Initiative proposes that the crimes be investigated at home. “One of the things that we have learned is that Mexico is rich in financial resources and human capital in these issues,” Mr. Goldston said. The Justice Initiative has been working in Mexico for more than a decade. But the investigations “simply haven’t happened because in our view the political will is not there,” Mr. Goldston said. The report “explains how we have reached this state of impunity,” said José Antonio Guevara, the director of the Mexican Commission for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights. The government’s “understanding at the highest level is that what they’re doing is the right thing to weaken organized crime,” he said. The commission was one of five Mexican groups that helped prepare the Justice Initiative report. To break that impunity, the report proposes that Mexico accept international help from outside prosecutors with the authority to investigate and prosecute atrocities and corruption cases. Mexico’s human rights crisis has commanded international attention since 43 students from a local teachers’ college were abducted by local police officers working with a drug gang in the southern city of Iguala in September 2014 as the federal police and military stood by. “The impunity in Mexico and the circuits of corruption are such that they generate pacts so solid that international intervention is needed,” said Santiago Aguirre, the deputy director of the Miguel Agustín Pro Juárez Center for Human Rights. One model for what the report suggests is in neighboring Guatemala, where independent prosecutors uncovered a customs fraud scheme that brought down the president last year. The Mexican government rejected the idea. “Our country has the capacity and the will to meet human rights challenges,” it said. The government pointed to the drop in complaints to the National Human Rights Commission, to 538 last year from 1, 450 in 2012. It also described recent changes designed to reduce abuses, including proposed laws and protocols to prevent torture and investigate disappearances. A new law for victims is in effect, and this month courts will begin to switch from written to oral trials. Critics are skeptical that the changes will make much of a difference unless they are carried out effectively. As long as prosecutors in Mexico remain subject to political power, said Mr. Aguirre, the impunity will continue. “What’s the incentive for a prosecutor to be independent? None,” he said. Without real investigations, there are thousands of parents like the Parrals, who trudge from one government office to another in search of answers. It was only through a case file number that appeared on an army document 10 months after their son disappeared that they found his body. Tucked into the archives at the state prosecutor’s office was their son’s government ID, which had been found at the ranch. But his body had been tossed into a common grave. An army investigation dismissed the case, and it languished with federal prosecutors before it was turned back to state prosecutors. “We think the army is hiding something to protect the commanding officers from the atrocities they carry out,” said Mr. Parral’s father, Jorge Parral Gutiérrez. “We can see that the prosecutors are not free to act. ” “The message is that the army   …   ” began Mr. Parral. His wife finished the sentence: “   …     has obstructed justice in every way. ”"
6633,6633,24962,"Congolese Politician, Jean-Pierre Bemba, Sentenced to 18 Years for War Crimes - The New York Times",New York Times,Marlise Simons,2016-06-24,2016.0,6.0,,"PARIS  —   A former vice president of the Democratic Republic of Congo,   Bemba, was sentenced on Tuesday to 18 years in prison for crimes against humanity and war crimes committed by militiamen under his command during a   rampage of looting, rape and murder in the Central African Republic. The sentence, handed down by an international panel of judges in The Hague, is considered significant for a number of reasons. Notably, Mr. Bemba was convicted even though he was far away from the militia fighting under his orders and was not present during any of the war crimes the court said he was culpable because of his command responsibility. He should have halted or prevented the crimes, the judges said. Mr. Bemba, who is now 53, was a businessman and scion of a prominent Congolese family before rising to the vice presidency  —   successful, rich and believed to be untouchable. In 2002, he sent an expeditionary force of his political party, the Congolese Liberation Movement, into the Central African Republic to help put down a military coup there. Though Mr. Bemba rarely visited the troops, the judges at the International Criminal Court in The Hague found that he closely monitored their activities, and convicted him in March. Sylvia Steiner, the presiding judge in the case, read out a summary of the court’s reasoning at the sentencing on Tuesday, saying that Mr. Bemba’s “knowledge of the crimes was unquestionable. ” He did more than tolerate them, he deliberately “encouraged attacks on civilians,” the judge said. The force of about 1, 500 militiamen rampaged through towns on their path, claiming afterward that they had been poorly paid and that they were rewarding themselves by raping and pillaging. The sentence given to Mr. Bemba heavily emphasized the militia’s unrelenting campaign of rape, “committed throughout the operation,” against women and men, adults and children. The judges cited instances of gang rape, and took note of the lasting physical and social harm that rape victims suffered, including stigmatization, ostracism and disease. Because of the large number of rapes and what the judges called their particular brutality, rape as a war crime and a crime against humanity received more weight in sentencing even than murder  —   18 years for the   charges, with concurrent sentences of 16 years for murder and pillaging. Prosecutors had asked for a   sentence, and may appeal the sentence as too lenient, experts following the case said. Victims’ groups had asked for Mr. Bemba to be sentenced to the maximum possible penalty, without citing a specific figure. Mr. Bemba had already been detained for eight years before and during his trial, so he would presumably now have 10 years left in his sentence if it stands at 18 years. It has been customary at international tribunals to deduct   of the total sentence, so Mr. Bemba may be eligible for early release in as little as four years. Largely because of pressure from human rights advocates and women’s groups, organized or mass rape is increasingly being recognized and prosecuted as a weapon of war rather than as a byproduct of war. Other international courts have convicted defendants of rape as a war crime and a crime against humanity, but Mr. Bemba’s was the first such conviction by the International Criminal Court. In two earlier cases involving Congolese warlords, instances of rape were widely reported but not prosecuted. In another twist, Mr. Bemba and four associates, including his former lead lawyer, are on trial in a parallel case at the same court, charged with trying to bribe witnesses in the war crimes case. Hearings in the    trial have been completed, and a verdict is expected later this year. Witness tampering has become a major issue at the court, with allegations of bribery or intimidation occurring in almost every case so far. Some critics have called the contempt prosecution against Mr. Bemba and his associates a waste of time and resources, but lawyers who follow the matter say the court wanted to send a strong message by pursuing it. In Kinshasa, the capital of Congo, members of Mr. Bemba’s political party, which he still heads, criticized the sentencing on Tuesday. “We will continue, and we will never cease, denouncing the selective justice of the I. C. C. ,” Eve Bazaiba told a few hundred supporters, according to Reuters. Géraldine   of Human Rights Watch said the sentence offered a measure of justice to victims in a country where armed groups have preyed on civilians with impunity for more than a decade. Ms.   who recently visited the Central African Republic, said that “many grave crimes, including the systematic use of sexual violence, remain unpunished” both there and in Congo. More than 5, 000 civilian victims participated in the court proceedings and may be awarded reparations payments. Judge Steiner said the court would deal with reparations in a separate ruling."
7069,7069,25561,"‘Born a Crime,’ Trevor Noah’s Raw Account of Life Under Apartheid - The New York Times",New York Times,Michiko Kakutani,2016-12-02,2016.0,12.0,,"As host of “The Daily Show,” Trevor Noah comes across as a wry, startled and sometimes outraged outsider, commenting on the absurdities of American life. During the presidential campaign, the South   comic remarked that Donald J. Trump reminded him of an African dictator, mused over the mystifying complexities of the Electoral College system and pointed out the weirdness of states voting on recreational marijuana. In the countdown to and aftermath of the election, Mr. Noah has grown more comfortable at moving back and forth between jokes and earnest insights, between humor and serious asides  —   the way he’s done in his   act, and now, in his compelling new memoir, “Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood. ” By turns alarming, sad and funny, his book provides a harrowing look, through the prism of Mr. Noah’s family, at life in South Africa under apartheid and the country’s lurching entry into a postapartheid era in the 1990s. Some stories will be familiar to fans who have followed the author’s   act. But his accounts here are less the polished anecdotes of a comedian underscoring the absurdities of life under apartheid, than raw, deeply personal reminiscences about being “   ” in a country where his birth “violated any number of laws, statutes and regulations. ” The son of a Xhosa mother and a   father, Mr. Noah recalls that “the only time I could be with my father was indoors”: “If we left the house, he’d have to walk across the street from us. ” It was dangerous, as a   child, to be seen with his mother as well: “She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn’t hers. ” He spent much of his time at home: “I didn’t have any friends. I didn’t know any kids besides my cousins. I wasn’t a lonely kid  —   I was good at being alone. I’d read books, play with the toy that I had, make up imaginary worlds. I lived inside my head. To this day you can leave me alone for hours and I’m perfectly happy entertaining myself. I have to remember to be with people. ” Language, he discovered early on, was a way to camouflage his difference. His mother knew Xhosa, Zulu, German, Afrikaans, Sotho and used her knowledge “to cross boundaries, handle situations, navigate the world. ” She made sure that English was the first language her son spoke because “if you’re black in South Africa, speaking English is the one thing that can give you a leg up. ” “English is the language of money,” Mr. Noah goes on. “English comprehension is equated with intelligence. If you’re looking for a job, English is the difference between getting the job or staying unemployed. ” A gifted mimic, Trevor learned to become “a chameleon,” using language to gain acceptance in school and on the streets. “If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu,” he writes. “If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn’t look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you. ” Mr. Noah offers a series of   snapshots of life in the township of Soweto, where his maternal grandmother lived, and where, he recalls, “99. 9 percent” of the residents were black, and his light skin made him a neighborhood curiosity. He remembers: “The township was in a constant state of insurrection someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to be suppressed. Playing in my grandmother’s house, I’d hear gunshots, screams, tear gas being fired into crowds. ” To save money, Mr. Noah recalls, his mother perfected the art of coasting their old, rusty Volkswagen downhill “between work and school, between school and home,” and enlisting her son’s help in pushing the car when the gas ran out. One month, he says, money was so short that they were forced to subsist on bowls of wild spinach, cooked with mopane worms, “the cheapest thing that only the poorest of poor people eat. ” By high school, Mr. Noah writes, he had become an enterprising businessman, copying and selling pirated CDs he and his business partners would soon segue into the D. J. business, throwing raucous dance parties in Alexandra, “a tiny, dense pocket of a shantytown,” known as Gomorrah because it had “the wildest parties and the worst crimes. ” After Mr. Noah’s father moved to Cape Town, his mother married an auto mechanic, whose English name, Abel, recalled the good brother in the Bible, but whose Tsonga name, Ngisaveni, says Mr. Noah, meant “Be afraid. ” Those names would turn out to be a harbinger of his stepfather’s dual personality  —   charming and eager to be liked on the surface, but, as Mr. Noah recalls, highly controlling, and capable of violence. In the end, “Born a Crime” is not just an unnerving account of growing up in South Africa under apartheid, but a love letter to the author’s remarkable mother, who grew up in a hut with 14 cousins, and determined that her son would not grow up paying what she called “the black tax”  —   black families having to “spend all of their time trying to fix the problems of the past,” using their skills and education to bring their relatives “back up to zero,” because “the generations who came before you have been pillaged. ” It’s the story of a fiercely religious woman, who attributes her miraculous survival from a gunshot wound to the head (inflicted by Abel) to her faith a woman who took her son to three churches on Sunday (as well as a prayer meeting on Tuesday, Bible study on Wednesday and youth church on Thursday) even when there were dangerous riots in the streets and few dared to venture out of their homes. The names chosen for Xhosa children traditionally have meanings, Mr. Noah observes: His mother’s name, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, means “She Who Gives Back” his cousin’s name, Mlungisi, means “The Fixer. ” His mother, Mr. Noah writes, deliberately gave him a name, Trevor, with “no meaning whatsoever in South Africa, no precedent in my family. ” “It’s not even a biblical name,” he writes. “It’s just a name. My mother wanted her child beholden to no fate. She wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone. ”"

The woman, Yasmin Seweid, a student at Baruch College, was also charged with obstructing governmental administration, the police said. Both charges are misdemeanors. Ms. Seweid, of New Hyde Park on Long Island, had told the police that three white men screaming “Donald Trump!” attacked her on Dec. 1 on an uptown No. 6 train at East 23rd Street, DNAinfo. com reported. She told the police that the men had called her a terrorist and that when she tried to move to the other end of the subway car, one of them followed and tried to pull off her traditional head scarf. DNAinfo reported that she recanted the story on Tuesday and had made it up to get attention because of problems she was having with her family. It was not immediately clear if she had a lawyer. A spokesman for the Council on   Relations, Ibrahim Hooper, said in an interview on Wednesday that Muslims in America were feeling “tremendous psychological stress and pressure” that can result in episodes like this one. “No one out of the blue decides to make this kind of report,” he said. “Whenever there are these rare instances of alleged false reports  —   it’s still an allegation at this point  —   it’s used by the growing Islamophobic community to delegitimize and undermine the many legitimate   incidents. ”"
7175,7175,25705,A Brother’s Crimes and a Sister’s Betrayal Make ‘Judas’ a Dutch Best Seller - The New York Times,New York Times,Nina Siegal,2017-04-13,2017.0,4.0,,"AMSTERDAM  —   When he read the   sample of Astrid Holleeder’s memoir, “Judas,” in the spring, the Dutch publisher Oscar van Gelderen said he knew he had sensational material in his hands. A gangster boss who has become a celebrity criminal. A sister who knows his secrets, and fears for her life. A criminal justice system unable to keep him behind bars without her help. And the back story of a childhood that was “dysfunctional to the max,” Mr. van Gelderen said. Ms. Holleeder is the sister of Willem Holleeder, convicted of the 1983 kidnapping of the Dutch beer millionaire Freddy Heineken. He has been in and out of prison for years, but never for murder, though Ms. Holleeder calls him a “serial killer” in her book. Because she got close enough to tape him and agreed to testify against him, he is on trial again, this time facing six counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. Mr. van Gelderen’s instincts were right. The book, released in early November, has been the No. 1 best seller in the Netherlands for eight straight weeks, according to the Dutch   association CPNB. Rights have already been sold for publication in Danish, German and Swedish, and Little, Brown and Company in New York bought worldwide   rights this month. “Judas” is not a recounting of Mr. Holleeder’s famous misdeeds, but the story of a childhood that included regular beatings by an alcoholic father, and, later, of Mr. Holleeder’s   hold on his family. “In the writing, there’s this strangling feeling of a guy who is controlling everybody,” Mr. van Gelderen said. Ms. Holleeder, 51, a successful   lawyer, describes in chilling detail how, a year after their father’s death in 1991, Mr. Holleeder was released from prison and took his place as the family abuser. She recounts how painful it was to interact with him after the murder of her    Cor van Hout, Mr. Holleeder’s longtime friend and   in the Heineken kidnapping. She contends that Mr. Holleeder ordered that killing, and plans to testify to that effect in court. Ms. Holleeder has been observing the success of her book from the secret location where she has been living under protection since February, after an inmate in a   prison described being contracted by Mr. Holleeder  to arrange for the killing of Ms. Holleeder their sister, Sonja Holleeder, who was married to Mr. van Hout and a Dutch crime reporter who helped Astrid establish contact with the police. (Another brother, Gerard, has remained uninvolved in the case.) Astrid Holleeder agreed to speak with The New York Times only from a separate, secure location, and she said that she did not think she would ever be safe as long as her brother was alive. “He will not rest until we’re dead,” she said. “It’s about his pride. He cannot let his little sister take him down. ” Ms. Holleeder said that she wrote “Judas” as a kind of “last will and testament” for her daughter, who is 31 and has two children of her own. She said that testifying in court during the pretrial phase of the current case had so far felt ineffectual. (The trial is scheduled to begin in early 2017.) “I want to tell everything, but they haven’t given me the chance yet,” she said. “The book is just about how I feel, how we grew up, what in fact made me and my brother into the opponents that we are now. ” Even when the   manuscript was finished, Lebowski Publishers did not provide details of its contents to bookstores, for fear that Mr. Holleeder would try to prevent its release. But after the publisher disclosed information on a   television talk show the day before the book’s publication, the first print run of 80, 000 copies sold out immediately. About 400, 000 copies have been bought so far  —   a milestone in a country of about 17 million, where sales of 5, 000 copies are considered strong. “Judas” is a narrative in the present, with flashbacks to the Holleeders’ childhood. The account begins in January 2012, when Mr. Holleeder was released from prison after serving six years of a   sentence for extortion. Astrid Holleeder said she acted as a kind of consigliere for her brother  —   advising him on legal matters, arranging his safe house when he got out of prison and serving as a confidante  —   in an effort to get close enough to obtain material that she could share with the police. She started wearing a wire in 2013, and ultimately recorded hundreds of hours of conversations with her brother. Although the author describes the admiration she felt for her brother as a little girl, her adult attitude toward him is clear from an early passage in which she describes picking him up from a prison in Vught the last time he was released. “During his detention, my brother developed a serious heart condition,” she writes. “He barely survived, but he did because, as my mother used to say, a weed doesn’t perish. I was surprised he had a heart at all. ” Mr. Holleeder’s lawyers, Sander Janssen and Robert Malewicz, criticized the timing of the book’s publication. Mr. Holleeder has been back in the   prison in Vught since December 2014, but he has appeared regularly at pretrial hearings. “It’s not very favorable for any criminal case to have a book like this come out during the proceedings,” Mr. Janssen said by telephone. “You never know if a witness will tell you something because he or she knows about it, or because he or she read it in a book. ” Franklin Wattimena, a spokesman for the public prosecutor’s office, said that it learned about “Judas” only the day before it was released. The judges who will decide the case have said that they have not, and will not, read the book unless it is submitted as evidence. (There are no juries in the Netherlands trials are run, and decided, by three judges.) As for Mr. Holleeder, he reacted to the book with a brief statement for the panel of judges. “I have not terrorized my family,” he said. “If this book had not been about me, I would have been as shocked as everybody else is. What Astrid said is not the truth. ” Mr. van Hout, the   turned foe, once called Mr. Holleeder “Judas,” which inspired the title of the best seller. But today, Ms. Holleeder says she feels it is she who betrayed her brother. She said that she “hates” herself for turning against her brother, and that, in spite of everything, she still loves him. She said she knew, however, that it was necessary to speak out, “to end the problem for everyone else. ” “I betrayed him,” Ms. Holleeder said of testifying against him. “He trusted me with his life, he would tell me everything, and I was the only thing he had when he got out of prison. ” When the news broke that she would testify, she said she thought: “No, he cannot survive this. He’s fighting back, of course, but I don’t think he can win this time. ”"
7805,7805,26541,Surge in ’Honour Crimes’ and Forced Marriages in London,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,2017-04-08,2017.0,4.0,,"  “honour crimes” have risen by 40 per cent in five years in London, with the number of forced marriages doubling in the same period. [According to the figures, obtained by the Evening Standard, some of the children involved in the abuse were younger than   .  Since 2012, honour crimes reported to the Metropolitan Police rose to 1, 081 and those relating to forced marriages shot up to 367. Women and girls were the victims in the vast majority of reported incidents, with over half coming from “Asian” backgrounds, the paper reports. Knives and guns were involved in more than 70 incidents, and dozens of rapes and other sexual crimes were reported. Detective Chief Inspector Sam Faulkner, of the Met’s Community Safety Unit, said the crimes stem from communities using “cultural   religious justifications for male violence against women and girls and other people”. They were often based on traditions whereby “an individual, family and community’s honour is weighted on women and girls” he said, including refusing to go along with a marriage. “We see an increase in these types of offences as a positive step, an indication that victims have more confidence to report offences to police and seek the support they need” he added. Politicians today called the findings “troubling” “shocking” and “abhorrent”. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, told the Evening Standard: “Too many of these awful crimes are still hidden. There is no ‘honour’ in violence against women, rape, torture or abuse of a family member. “These are deadly crimes and there is still too little protection, too few prosecutions and too much stigma which prevents people coming forward. “It’s vital that when victims do speak out they get proper help from support groups and from the police to keep them safe. ” The figures, obtained using Freedom of Information requests, show that “violence against the person” was the most common “honour” attack, accounting for 85 per cent of incidents. Sexual violence was the second largest category, with 56 rapes and 11 “other sexual” crimes. 84 per cent were perpetrated against women, with “Asian” women accounting for more than half."

We expect when article 50 is triggered it will bring another level of discontent,” Barbara Drozdowicz, of the East European Resource Centre (EERC) told the Commons Home Affairs Committee. Ms. Drozdowicz fingered criticism of mass migration as a driver of ‘hate’ in response to a question by fierce Remain campaigner Chuka Umunna. The Labour MP pointed to “Leave. EU, UKIP obviously” when he asked the EERC director whether she believes the “Leave campaign” and   figures “bear a responsibility” for   attacks. “The campaign was built on controlling migration. ‘Controlling migration’ is not a neutral term,” she told MPs. When Conservative David Burrowes noted that most examples of ‘hate’ are expressed online, community leaders admitted they’ve neither seen nor had reports of content on the internet that’s abusive to migrants from Europe. Tadeusz Stenzel, the chair of trustees at the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, suggested there might be a language barrier which prevents European migrants from being able to understand abusive posts and report them. MPs heard that European migrants began reporting ‘hate crimes’ in around April of last year as the referendum campaign got into gear, but that only after Britons voted to leave the European Union (EU) was the resource centre inundated with an “explosion of calls”. Ms. Drozdowicz said migrants from Eastern Europe reported being told to “go home” and hearing ‘casual hate speech’ on public transport and that the centre heard about violent incidents including a Polish child being beaten up at school. Chairman of the committee, Yvette Cooper, said the details of incidents that were talked about in the session were “appalling”. “Hate crime is appalling,   and should have no place in our country,” she said. Heading the government’s inquiry into ‘hate crime’ in November, Ms. Cooper accused the campaigns of both Leave, during the EU referendum, and Donald Trump, in the U. S. presidential race, of having incited hatred."
8168,8168,26904,DHS to Unveil VOICE Office for Victims of Illegal Alien Crime - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katie McHugh,2017-04-25,2017.0,4.0,,"The Department of Homeland Security announced Tuesday that Secretary John Kelly will formally unveil the Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) office at the ICE headquarters on Wednesday. [“There’s no intent to make a pun, but it really is to give a voice to the victims of crimes that have been committed by those who are in the country illegally,” said DHS spokesman David Lapan to reporters in Washington, D. C. in response to a skeptical question about why the government wants to launch a program helping Americans suffering from illegal alien crime. “There are a lot of offices and entities that do similar things for crime victims writ large, but nobody has the level of understanding of immigration that ICE does. And so it’s a way to keep victims and their families informed, and not just about the criminal justice aspects of their particular case, but the immigration aspects. ”  “That’s something that isn’t covered by other groups and offices who maintain contact with victims of crimes  …     So it’s a way to ensure that families and victims who have been affected by, again, those here illegally can understand where things are in the immigration process as well as in the criminal justice process,” he said. One month after President Donald Trump assumed office, Kelly instructed ICE to create a program to provide families devastated by illegal alien crime and share more information about the foreign perpetrators who committed the alleged crimes. “Criminal aliens routinely victimize Americans and other legal residents. Often, these victims are not provided adequate information about the offender, the offender’s immigration status, or any enforcement action taken by ICE against the offender,” Kelly said in a memo. Rallying to the sides of American families and legal immigrants was a critical part of Trump’s successful presidential campaign. Trump repeatedly brought families who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens on stage at campaign rallies, and was the only candidate to respond to an open letter pleading for a campaign to acknowledge and deliver justice to victimized and suffering American families. The immediacy of his campaign’s reply and the spotlight he shone on their plight was praised by an advocacy group that had fought for attention to the pressing issue for years. “Donald Trump is the only candidate whose office has responded to their open letter and that the candidate will support a national program to assist families of victims of illegal aliens. Their response was immediate and they have stated they will support our efforts in assisting our families,” said Maria Espinoza, head of the Remembrance Project. Her organization plans to open an office in Washington, D. C. to support the program. A December report estimated that some 820, 000 illegals evaded deportation under the Obama administration —  including roughly 620, 000 convicted of terrible crimes such as murder and rape.

[Jerusalem Police Spokeswoman Luba Simri explained the policeman was walking down a street near the Lion’s Gate, an entrance to the Old City, when the officer was stabbed in the face and body by the Jordanian citizen,    Mohammed Abdullah Salim  .  “The terrorist rushed toward him, whipped out a knife that he had in his possession, stormed him and began stabbing him. The police officer responded with determination and in a professional manner, managed to activate his weapon and neutralized the terrorist,” Simri told reporters. A second policeman was stabbed in the hand while helping to subdue the terrorist, who reportedly entered Israel several days ago. The Israeli police released graphic video of the attack (watch it below) in which Kasaji can clearly be seen repeatedly stabbing the policeman, who had been knocked to the floor.  Jordan’s Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv described the attack as an “ugly crime. ” Jordan was referring to the policeman’s   and not to the reportedly unprovoked terrorist attack by one of its own citizens. Jordan’s Minister of Communications Muhammad  ’man was quoted as saying, “The Israeli government, as the occupying power in Jerusalem, bears responsibility for the shooting of a Jordanian civilian who was killed. ” Mu’man failed to note that the terrorist, Kasaji, was killed while stabbing the officer. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the Jordanian statements. “It is time that Jordan ceases its double sided game. Just as Israel condemns terror attacks in Jordan, Jordan must condemn terrorist attacks in Israel. Terror is terror,” Netanyahu said. The Times of Israel further reported on today’s terrorist attack: The    police officer was taken to Jerusalem’s Shaare Tzedek Medical Center in moderate condition after the incident near the Lions’ Gate. He had wounds in the neck and head, and was conscious and in stable condition when evacuated to the hospital. A second man was lightly wounded, with cuts to the hand.   …    After the incident police arrested a local merchant who they suspected prevented   from helping the policeman during the attack.

8396,8396,27132,Hate Crime Hoax Finds Black Man Posing as Racist White Man in Obscene Letter Campaign - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2017-04-14,2017.0,4.0,,"An African American man in Tennessee was arrested for allegedly posing as a local white business owner and writing hoax letters pretending the businessman was a racist who was planning attacks on local black leaders. [Police in Knoxville, Tennessee, arrested Justin Lamar Coleman after they say he launched a campaign to discredit businessman Jeff McCown, the white owner of McCown Body Shop in Knoxville, according to the Knoxville News Sentinel.  Coleman came to the attention of police after it was reported by recipients that he sent letters to several African American leaders in the area, including Daryl Arnold, the pastor of Overcoming Believers Church in East Knoxville. Police said the letters contained racial epithets and threats of bodily harm toward the African American leaders and were signed as if the body shop owner had written them. One of the letters sent to Pastor Arnold’s daughter that was revealed by prosecutors read, “Tell your daddy Daryl to come to my paint and body shop call (sic) Jeff McCown. I wrote this letter (racial slur)   …     I hate (expletive, racial slur). I’m coming to your house to rape you. I’m going to get a chainsaw and cut your legs off and then cut your head off, black nasty (slur). ” The letter went on to threaten to castrate Pastor Arnold. The hoax letter concluded saying, “I am a very racist white man and with Mr. Trump in the White House being the Prisdent (sic) white people going to take over the world. ” It was signed as if the body shop owner had written it. Prosecutors also said there were other such letters allegedly sent by Coleman. Indeed, one was even sent to business owner McCown warning him that someone was going to kill him and burn his house down. Prosecutors say their investigation found that the letter writing campaign began over a confrontation Coleman had with McCown when Coleman drove over the grass in front of the body shop owner’s business back in 2010. A verbal altercation resulted after Coleman destroyed the landscaping with his truck. Coleman tried to charge the businessman with assault and for throwing rocks at his truck during the incident. Police investigated the 2010 accusations, but no proof was found to substantiate Coleman’s claims, and no charges were filed. In 2015 Coleman launched several social media attacks on McCown’s business, but the body shop owner ignored them. When Coleman realized the social media attack had no impact, he began to send the hoax letters to African American leaders, posing as a racist McCown. After pleading guilty, Coleman was placed under house arrest pending a hearing date. Assistant U. S. Attorney Jennifer Kolman opposed the lenient treatment, saying that the suspect posed a danger to the community. U. S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Guyton also ordered Coleman to receive mental health treatment after testimony revealed Coleman had past mental issues.

8466,8466,27202,Sudanese President Indicted for War Crimes Skips Saudi Islamic Summit - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,2017-05-20,2017.0,5.0,,"Sudanese President Omar   indicated through his state media on Friday that he would not attend this weekend’s Islamic Summit in Saudi Arabia, at which U. S. President Donald Trump will be a guest of honor. Trump is scheduled to deliver a major address on American relations with the Muslim world at the summit. [The Associated Press quotes Sudanese reports that Minister of State Taha   will be sent to the summit in Riyadh instead.  “President Omar   has apologized to King Salman of Saudi Arabia for being unable to attend the Riyadh summit,” said a statement from Bashir’s office. Undefined “personal reasons” were given as the reason for his absence. The New York Times notes that Saudi Arabia’s invitation to Bashir “outraged human rights advocates, who called it a breach of longstanding United States policy. ”  The policy in question calls for ostracizing accused war criminals with outstanding arrest warrants, of which Bashir boasts two, dating back to 2009 and 2010. The International Criminal Court describes him as a “suspect still at large. ” The list of charges is impressive: Five counts of crimes against humanity murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, and rape two counts of war crimes intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population as such or against individual civilians not taking part in hostilities, and pillaging three counts of genocide: by killing, by causing serious bodily or mental harm, and by deliberately inflicting on each target group conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction, allegedly committed at least between 2003 and 2008 in Darfur, Sudan. According to the United Nations, up to 300, 000 people have been killed in the Darfur genocide, and another 2. 3 million displaced into refugee camps. The U. S. State Department said it was opposed to “invitations, facilitation or support for travel by any person subject to outstanding International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrants, including President Bashir. ” Bashir usually encounters little difficulty when he wishes to travel, despite the war crimes charges against him. The International Criminal Court has filed complaints against several nations, including South Africa and Uganda, for refusing to arrest him when he traveled to their jurisdictions. This week, Bashir’s government confidently stated he would attend the Saudi summit and “participate actively,” with a particular emphasis on lifting U. S. sanctions against Sudan. “On his agenda for the summit will be the removal of sanctions finally which were imposed by the US on Sudan. Also on the top of the agenda is to how to combat and how to fight terrorism. What we know is that President Bashir and President Trump will be in the same conference hall, but we don’t know whether he will meet President Trump,” Rabie Abdul Atti, a senior member of the ruling Sudanese party said on Wednesday. CNN notes that prior to President Trump’s inauguration, the Obama administration played up Sudanese opposition to the Islamic State, and was working to ease some sanctions against Sudan as a reward for humanitarian progress in Darfur."
8614,8614,27350,Sweden Blocks Request for Data on Crime and Immigration,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,2017-01-18,2017.0,1.0,,"A request for data detailing the relationship between crime and immigration in Sweden has been blocked by the government. [The Sweden Democrats (SD) called for an investigation into the subject after a recent study showed that Swedish women feel increasingly insecure, and are hesitant to leave the house, fearing sexual harassment.  Figures on the proportion of crimes that are carried out by people born abroad have not been available since 2005, but with the arrival of a huge number of migrants in recent years, the populist party hoped a report could shed some light on whether women’s growing insecurity is connected to the influx. Justice minister Morgan Johansson denied the need for updated statistics on immigration and crime because it would be unlikely to herald any new information. He told SVT News: “Sweden’s earlier figures and numerous international studies all show much the same thing. Minority groups are often overrepresented in crime statistics, but when controlling for socioeconomic factors this [the overrepresentation of minority groups] disappears almost entirely. ” The minister’s statement was slammed by Kurdish economist Tino Sanandaji, who outlined the flaws in the study to which Johansson referred, and wrote: “It is illogical to deny the criminality of migrants with the argument that criminal migrants are poor. ” The SD initiative gained support from only one person in another party, Centre Party MP Staffan Danielsson, who dissented from his party’s line to argue that it would be counterproductive to keep the information concealed. “There were reports in 1996 and 2005. Now it’s 11 years on and we have migration that’s on an entirely different level. “There are people who believe that almost no Swedes commit crime, and that it’s only   who do. Apparently this isn’t true. Facts are the only thing I’m after,” he told SVT. Sweden’s criminology establishment has been accused of deliberately concealing the relationship between immigration and crime, which critics say denies authorities the chance to prevent crime and learn from previous mistakes."

Mayor Silent on City’s Rising Violent Crime - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,2017-02-19,2017.0,2.0,,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s campaign traded barbs with mayoral challenger (and fellow Democrat) Mitchell Schwartz last week over the city’s    rising violent crime rate. [During a Northridge East Neighborhood Council candidate forum, Schwartz accused Garcetti of concealing rising crime statistics by not holding an annual news conference on them at the end of the year, according to the Los Angeles Daily News. Garcetti spokesman Yusef Robb slammed Schwartz’s “conspiracy theory” as he tried to explain away the lack of news conference as a scheduling matter. He went on to claim that L. A. crime is at “historic lows” and blamed the state for failures associated with prison sentence reductions under 2014’s Proposition 47.  Violent crime in Los Angeles was up 10 percent in 2016 from 2015, according to the Daily News, which noted that the crime statistics were quietly rolled out on the police department’s website. In prior years the statistics were announced jointly and very publicly by the mayor and chief of police. Schwartz has been campaigning on his goal to add 2, 500 police officers to the city’s police department, according to the report. Another mayoral challenger, Paul Amori, piled on the criticism of Garcetti, saying that “crime is up massively” under Garcetti’s watch, though he didn’t blame Garcetti alone. This week, San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer highlighted San Diego’s    decrease in violent crime while noting in a statement that violent crime in Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Antonio and Dallas had higher rates. In January, Garcetti spent several days fundraising in Chicago, Washington D. C and New York for his   bid. Earlier the same month, former Vice President Joe Biden appeared at a fundraiser for Garcetti in Beverly Hills. In early February, Garcetti took time to appear on MSNBC, stating that if Los Angeles police were enforcing immigration law, they couldn’t be out solving crimes. Garcetti has repeatedly criticized President Donald Trump’s plans to enforce immigration law and warnings that sanctuary cities face losing federal dollars. Aides to Garcetti said that on March 3 Garcetti and Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck will roll out a “public safety initiative. ” Garcetti has also been the target of protests by Black Lives Matter activists, who President Trump and other critics have blamed for making the tasks facing police in inner cities more difficult.

[Obama made his remarks in the context of a discussion of race relations and whether or not they had gotten better or worse during his presidency.  “I don’t think it’s accurate to say that race relations have gotten worse,” he said, blaming social media, smart phones, and the internet for “surfacing” more incidents of racial violence. “What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,” he said in an interview with local Chicago station CBS 2. “Whether it’s tensions between police and communities, hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook. ” The suspects, Jordan Hill, 18 Tesfaye Cooper, 18 Brittany Covington, 18 and Tanishia Covington, 24 were charged with criminal hate crimes and aggravated kidnapping as well as other felony charges, according to NBC News.  Obama also discussed the horrifying incident in an interview with Chicago’s ABC7. “It’s terrible,” he said. “And so part of technology allows us to see now is the terrible toll that racism and discrimination and hate takes on families and communities. But that’s part of how we learn and how we get better. ” Obama argued that it was alarming to see the new images on social media, but that it would help society root out the scourge of racism. “We don’t benefit from pretending that racism doesn’t exist and hate doesn’t exist, we don’t benefit from not talking about it,” he said. “The fact that these things are being surfaced means we can solve them. ” Obama remained convinced that race relations were getting better, citing the Council Wars in Chicago when he first arrived in 1985. “I promise you, for the most part, race relations have gotten better,” he said."
9040,9040,27776,Police Hope LGBT Police Car Will Boost Reporting of ‘Hate Crime’,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,2017-01-19,2017.0,1.0,,"Lancashire Police has introduced a “Police with Pride” vehicle to their fleet, in the hope of encouraging more people to report ‘hate crimes’. [The white and   police car will be fully operational and used by the immediate response team to attend incidents around the clock across Blackpool, where it will be based.  The aim of the vehicle, on which the words “Lancashire Constabulary values diverse communities” are emblazoned, is to “engage with the gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans community to raise awareness of hate crime and domestic abuse and to encourage more people to report incidents” according to a Facebook post by Lancashire LGBT Policing Team. It will also attend ‘Pride’ events across the region throughout the year, with Blog Preston noting that the colourful car will be making an appearance in the city for this reason in summer. Lancashire’s Deputy Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said: “We are committed to equality and valuing difference and supporting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. “By having a car that has a bold statement is just one way of demonstrating that commitment. ” Police and Crime Commissioner Clive Grunshaw added: “As Police and Crime Commissioner I am always looking for ways to demonstrate that the police are aware of their local communities and keen to reflect them in everything they do. “This car is just one aspect of that and again this year the Constabulary and my office will be supporting Blackpool Pride and encouraging the LGB and T community to work with us to end hate crime. ” Writing on Lancashire LGBT Policing Team’s page, Facebook user Laura Myers welcomed the fleet’s new addition, writing: “Good on you   …    .

It was reported on Thursday that Brighton and Hove’s former police commander, Nev Kemp, has been named Stonewall’s Senior Champion of the Year in its 2017 Workplace Equality Index. The commander’s spirited defence of an LGBT police vehicle was cited by the organisation as a key reason in their decision to issue him with the award. Stonewall said: “Nev’s passion and tenacity were demonstrated when he responded to a criticism over a Sussex Police rainbow police car for Brighton Pride 2015 by covering the largest vehicle he could find (a van) in rainbows for Pride 2016. ”"
9049,9049,27785,State to Block Removal of Migrant Victims of ‘Right Wing’ Crime,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,2017-01-04,2017.0,1.0,,"A German federal state is considering forbidding the deportation of all migrants who happen to witness, or are victims of, “right wing” crimes when in Germany. [Brandenburg’s state parliament became the first in Germany to offer migrant victims of crime extra rights last year, after a rise in recorded “right wing” attacks. The new   measure is being pushed by the Ministry of the Interior.  “In addition to consistently preventing and prosecuting criminal offences, special protection of the victims and special care are necessary if the victims are people of foreign origin” proclaimed a decree of the Ministry of the Interior, issued in December 2016. It is argued that new arrivals are uniquely vulnerable, without support networks in Germany, and deportation could make their lives harder. The regional parliament also “decided, among other things, to ask the regional government to make sure that victims of right [wing] violent crimes are offered the possibility of being issued with residence permits and tolerances  …    ” It is believed this measure could help deter xenophobia and “far right” attacks on migrants, as such activity will only result in more migrants being allowed to stay in Germany. Migrants who commit a crime, or share responsibility for a violent incident when in Germany, will be exempt from the new rule. A resolution issued by the parliament in April 2016, in response to rising numbers of reported “right wing” crime, said “the victims of racist violent acts are migrant women as well as refugees” and argued that “such offences would be particularly difficult if their stay in the Federal Republic is unsecured”. According to the decree, crimes linked to the “right wing” in Brandenburg increased by 23 per cent in 2015  —   the year the Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany’s borders to more than 1 million irregular migrants. According to Die Welt, the populist,   migration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been critical of the new proposed policy."

[Hundreds of   programs assist illegal aliens, but not a single program exists specifically to help American victims of illegal alien crime, they told SiriusXM host Matthew Boyle.  Organized by the Remembrance Project’s Maria Espinoza, the Angel Moms described the immense emotional and financial costs burdening their families —  and government’s complete indifference. “The national program we put forth —  Mr. Trump is the only candidate who met with us, of course, but also who agreed to support the Remembrance Project national program that would help with burial, medical, and counseling expenses,” said Espinoza. “Also, what’s very important that people don’t understand that in so many cases, our families are being   because they’re being misguided in the court system. Either activist judges, or activist prosecutors —  so we really need someone to help and guide our families. ” “Who can afford an attorney for themselves? And here illegal aliens get one. If they murder an American, they are given two attorneys to protect them, to defend them,” she added. Ruth Johnston Martin, whose husband was shot by an illegal alien, said there is not one government program out there to help those suffering a loss due to illegal alien crime.  “Well, first of all, everyone listening has a family. Just imagine waking up one day and having one of those family members ripped away from you in such a violent and horrifying way. You’re never the same. You need that counseling,” she said.  “You have to understand the depression that sets in —  these individuals need something, someone to reach out to. Someone that’s going to circle the wagons around them. That program will be that source. It’s a resource. And you know, it is true —  there’s over 300 programs for illegal aliens,” Martin continued.   “But there’s nothing to help the families of those who have lost loved ones at the hands of these individuals. So they don’t have to suffer in silence. They have someone they can reach out to. ”  “There’s many that just go into a state of depression. There are some that commit suicide. There are some that go to drinking. It doesn’t have to be that way,” she said. “They need the assistance, and it’s about time we had a president that says, ‘You know what, you’re an American. We’re here for you. We’re here to assist you.’ And that is exactly what he will do. ”  Laura Wilkerson, who summoned the strength to tell the story of her son Joshua’s violent death at the hands of an illegal alien classmate over and over again, said the trauma can leave one unable to live a normal life, or even do everyday tasks.  “When you lose a child, and the trauma that is involved with Josh’s case, you are just absolutely broken to the core. You don’t know if you can breathe. I mean really, it’s a start to learn to breathe all over again and learning to crawl, and then to walk,” she said. “You feel like an infant. Your mind knows that you’re not, but you can’t help but have the trauma with it. ”  “I sat in the trial and watched this kid who was just excited about what he did to Josh, and he got up off the stand and demonstrated to the district attorney about how he strangled Josh, and he never had an ounce of remorse. And, this was two years after Joshua died,” she said. “It was two years before it was brought to trial. And then you sit there and watch him just excited about what he did to Joshua. You’ve never been faced with the evil, and with the trauma. ” “My husband and I own a small business, and it’s very hard to —  you know, you’re scrapping and fighting every day to make it anyway, and you can’t do the things you used to do. And it takes you a long time to process that your child is not coming back, ever, and then on top of that to just do daily things. I couldn’t make a meal for my family for probably about a year and a half,” she said. “You know something’s messed up, and you just can’t do it. ” “Everything becomes like climbing a mountain, and you really need help,” she added.  Legal immigrant Agnes Gibboney, whose son Ronald da Silva was murdered in 2002 by an illegal alien, said families desperation need lawyers in their corner when fighting for justice.  “With this national program to allow families to have legal representation, so your rights won’t be violated in a court of law,” she said, adding she only had the prosecutor to look out for her. “Everything went wrong. I was not allowed to say my impact statement. I was not allowed to address the court. I was not allowed to get the probation hearing report. And when I called them to ask how come I didn’t get it, they said, ‘My boss told me not to talk to you,’ and hung up. ” Wilkerson said she paid out of her own pocket for an attorney just to sit through the trial of her son’s murderer. “They didn’t want me to sit in the trial, and I had to hire an attorney just to make that happen. ” She “couldn’t imagine” not being present in the courtroom while others heard about the death of her son.

9285,9285,28021,Migrant Crime and Violence Soars in German States - Breitbart,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,2017-03-14,2017.0,3.0,,"Authorities in two German states have expressed concern over official figures showing a huge rise in migrant crime, with the number of violent attacks having almost doubled in 2016. [“Refugees really entered onto the crime scene last year,” said   State Criminal Police Office (LKA) president Ralf Michelfelder.  “We are very worried about the rise in violence by asylum seekers,” the police official added. The comments come following the release of figures which reveal a 95. 5 per cent spike in the number of physical attacks carried out by asylum seekers and migrants. Around 60 per cent of the assaults take place in asylum accommodation but the other 40 per cent are carried out among the general public. This group of migrants are also heavily represented among people caught for theft and drug offences, according to this year’s statistics. But “they can now be found as suspects of crimes in almost every field” according to the police official. Of a total of 251, 000 criminal suspects across the state in 2016, 107, 417 were foreign, with 25, 379 of these being asylum seekers and refugees. Syria was the most frequently seen country of origin in the latter category, followed by Gambia, and then Afghanistan. In Bavaria, the number of crimes committed by immigrants rose 57. 8 per cent from the previous year, a development which the state’s Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann described as “worrying”. “The increase in crime in Bavaria in 2016 is mainly due to foreign suspects, especially immigrants,” the minister said. There had been a 3. 3 per cent overall rise in the number of crimes statewide (the figure adjusted to remove offences like illegal immigration). The number of homicides in Bavaria increased by 15 per cent in 2016, while violent crimes carried out by asylum seekers rose by 93 per cent to 3, 495 cases. Of thefts which occurred across the German state, 42. 8 per cent of suspects were of foreign origin  —   an almost 1 per cent rise from the previous year. Earlier this year, the Berlin Senate launched a formal inquiry to find out why migrants are overrepresented in the city’s police crime reports compared to Germans.

[“These are challenges like we’ve never seen before” said Uppsala police commissioner Daniel Larsson, quoted in a press release on the force’s website which states the city has “a brand new street scene [  …    ] today compared to just a few years ago. ”  Between summer 2015 and summer 2016 the city also saw a 60 per cent rise in muggings, and police reported that officers feel they are facing a “harsher climate and reduced respect for their profession” while out on patrol. Drugs are one of the key factors driving the crime wave in Uppsala, according to the city’s police, with sales of illicit substances including heroin taking place out in the open. At the end of February, Uppsalatidningen reported a huge uptick over previous weeks in the number of young people addicted to drugs who are committing robberies to fund their addiction. Recent cases noted by the newspaper include that of a    man and a    man who were attacked in muggings where the criminals seized, or attempted to wrest, jewellery from their victims’ person. Mr Larsson said the robberies are linked to rocketing use of heroin  —   a problem he says was previously unknown in the city  —   and that “at least 90 unaccompanied minors” are using the drug at the Travel Centre. Noting that people from Afghanistan are “ ” among the abusers, the police commissioner suggested that this is down to the country’s history of opium production as well as “well known problems of segregation”. Another type of theft the police say is on the rise due to drug abuse is where large groups of young people will enter retail shops and draw the staff’s attention while thefts are carried out in other parts of the store. Workers in Uppsala are feeling increasingly insecure too, due to groups of youths congregating after dark, according to area police officer Magnus Sundberg. On Friday, Moderate party MP Marta Obminska wrote to Sweden’s interior minister about crime plaguing the city, where she said “people, not just girls” now find it uncomfortable to go outside. “And this doesn’t just apply during the night. People avoid the Travel Centre and some parts of town. They are attacked with a knife or gun from behind. This is not the Uppsala we desire. “According to the police, there are ninety unaccompanied refugees in Uppsala who abuse heroin. Muggings are also carried out by the Moroccan street children. They are suspected to be a big part of personal robberies  —   performed to fund addiction  —   but also other criminal acts” wrote the MP. Describing the situation as “serious” and noting there was even a shooting in the city this weekend, Ms Obminska told 24Uppsala. se that “muggings take place regularly, from early evening to morning. ” The Swedish establishment has been keen to discredit claims that its open border policy has led to trouble. U. S. President Donald J. Trump drew attention to the Nordic nation recently, stating at a rally that the country is “having problems like they never thought possible” as a result of mass migration. Slamming the President’s speech as having been designed “to send a message that large scale migration harms a country” Sweden’s former Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt insisted that mass migration had made the country safer. But Integration Minister lva Johansson was forced into an embarrassing   on Saturday after she falsely told BBC the number of reported rapes in the country was falling. Having drawn sharp criticism from MPs, economists, and criminologists, the liberal minister had to correct herself after being told that reported rapes had risen 13 per cent from the previous year."

CEO Gary Miliefsky joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday’s Breitbart News Daily to talk about the massive ransomware attack that swept the world over the weekend. [Miliefsky said the details of the story sounded like something from a movie script: “This group called the ‘Shadow Brokers’ got ahold of NSA   eavesdropping worm code, malware that worms its way across vulnerabilities in Windows, and somebody merged it with ransomware and created the world’s first ransom worm. ”  “The software doesn’t just affect you if you click a link. You may click the link and get infected then have to pay the ransom. But it also worms its way across your Intranet looking for more computers with same vulnerability,” he elaborated. Marlow asked if the outbreak of this malevolent software was under control after the chaotic events of the weekend. “A lot of people worldwide have gotten concerned about it, but you’re not going to believe the numbers. Over the weekend, we thought it was slowing down. It started out, it hit about 100, 000 computers by Sunday. By the end of the day yesterday, it was about 179, 000. Today, sadly, the numbers are more than double. We’re at 367, 589 infected,” Miliefsky replied. “Most of them are offline. That means they’ve been unplugged from the Internet so that people can decide: ‘Do I wipe the drive and reinstall, or am I going to pay the fee? But I don’t want it to propagate to other computers.’ But there’s still about 426 computers online that continue to propagate the worm,” he added. Milifesky said his company’s technology, which he unsuccessfully tried to sell to the “big guys” in the computer industry, is focused on protecting “small to   enterprises where all the GDP really comes from. ” “And guess what? All of our customers in the SME [Small and   Enterprise] space can not get infected with this worm. We can block it in milliseconds,” he said. “I’ve had technology to do this for years, but I can’t sell it to the big guys. It’s called NetShield. ” He explained that NetShield is a corporate product that was the first software to “go on the offensive” against malware.  “For consumers, I have some great advice today,” he said. “I put a consumer advisory out, and you can just Google it, ‘SnoopWall consumer advisory.’ In the advisory, I have links to the current stats of the worm infection, what countries are getting infected in real time. But I also have a link to Microsoft’s TechNet page where they didn’t really want to tell everyone right away, two months ago they had the fix. So I have the link to the fix for every version of Windows in that advisory. ” Marlow asked about   reports that a North Korean hacking group appeared to be behind the ransomware attack. “I’ve been told by someone who’s connected to someone in Anonymous that there’s actually, believe it or not, a kind of Russian cyber arms dealer who sells weaponized malware, somewhere in Russia, and also hacks videogames, and that person may have sold it to North Korea,” Miliefsky said. “I don’t know much more, I’m told that on hearsay, but I’m passing that on to the authorities and I know they’re going to research it. ” Miliefsky said this was a “watershed moment in cybercrime history. ” “I have to tell you, drug crime in 2015 was bigger than any other form of crime worldwide. By 2016, cybercrime surpassed drug crime and reached $600 billion. This year, I’m predicting cybercrime will be a   industry. It is not going to go away. It is only going to get worse,” he warned.

9691,9691,28427,Lott: Police Commit More Gun Crimes Than Concealed Carry Permit Holders,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2017-05-27,2017.0,5.0,,"Crime Prevention Research Center’s (CPRC) John Lott points out that police are convicted of gun crime at a higher rate than permit holders. [Lott’s assessment is not for the purpose of disparaging police. Instead, it is to show that concealed carry permit holders are among the most   citizens, and their armed presence on campus is a deterrent, rather than a cause for concern.  Writing in the Hill’s May 26 column, Lott highlights the left’s claims that concealed carry permit holders make college campuses less safe. He points out that the left has reacted to proposed campus carry legislation in state after state by warning that armed,   citizens on campus would make classrooms and universities more dangerous. But the danger has not materialized, even though campus carry has been in effect in some states for 14 years. For example, it has been the law in Colorado since 2003 and in Utah since 2004. It has become law in numerous other states since then, including Arkansas and Georgia this year. But where are the crimes? The Wild West shootouts? The bullets whistling through the air on campus carry campuses? These are no where to be found because concealed carry permit holders are generally not criminals. Lott explains that the left opposed   concealed carry when it began to sweep the country in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and they used the same arguments then that they use now when decrying arming   citizens for   on campus. They largely argue that only trained   should be armed on campus. They intimate that allowing students to be armed will only lead to a more dangerous campus setting. Lott counters, “Permits have been revoked for   violations at rates of thousandths of one percentage point. Civilian permit holders are less likely than police officers to be convicted of a firearms violation. ” He links to a CPRC study that shows that from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007, the yearly rate of misdemeanors and felonies by   police officers was . 102 percent. The yearly rate for Texas’ concealed carry permit holders in the year 2015, the year campus carry was signed into law in that state, was . 0102 percent. Lott then shows that from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2007, the yearly rate for firearms violations was . 017 percent. The yearly rate for Texas’ concealed carry permit holders in 2015 was . 0024 percent.

[Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, arrested the      for allegedly setting fire to a market owned by an immigrant from Bhutan. The arsonist left a note, which began: “Our newly elected president Donald Trump is our nation builder for white America. ”  The culprit in the   and fire not only attempted to depict white supporters of the president as violent racists, but as   as well. “You all know that, we want our country back on the right track,” he informed. “We need to get rid of Muslims, Indians and all immigrants. Specially, we don’t want business by refugees and immigrant any more. ” The staged hate crime mirrors several other faux attacks on religious and ethnic minorities in the wake of Donald Trump’s political emergence. In Manhattan in December, a Muslim woman claimed a trio of white drunks assaulted her on a crowded subway train and pulled on her hijab while chanting   slogans and issuing   taunts. Earlier in Mississippi, news reports indicated a hate crime when “Vote Trump” appeared   on a   black church. Police later arrested an   parishioner for the crime.

[Breitbart London spoke to recently retired Swedish police officer Torsten Elofsson in 2015 as his heavily resettled home city of Malmo was experiencing a serious spike in attacks committed by migrant communities with smuggled hand grenades.  The former INTERPOL officer and director of Swedish criminal intelligence division said the population of the city, which has been the first point of entry for tens of thousands of illegal migrants as they moved north through Europe into Scandinavia, had gone up by 50 per cent in two decades but the number of officers to police it had halved. Senior cop Elofsson told Breitbart: Sweden became a member of the European Union in 1995 and opened our borders. We are part of the Schengen treaty, so you have that freedom of movement which has also brought criminality here  …     Gun and drug related crime has definitely increased. Until recently the possession of guns by criminals was very rare  —   now finding people with firearms is a daily occurrence here  …     most of the guns we seize are used in criminal activity, are held illegally, and are smuggled into Sweden. Slovakia is very interesting right now  —   it is very easy to buy deactivated guns there but they are converted back when they are imported here. Malmo is infamous for explosions. Yet thankfully nobody has been killed by the explosions yet  —   some of them are just used to frighten people. We had one case in Rosengard where a group were given a court order to leave an apartment because they were a disturbance for the neighbours. And then suddenly hand grenades and explosions outside the office of the real estate company. Explaining the rise of populist,   migration parties like the Sweden Democrats Mr Elofsson said normal voters were starting to realise the rosy picture painted by centrist politicians didn’t tally up with their everyday experiences. He said:   …    the politicians, the media sends out a message that everything is safe and secure, you don’t have to worry. But people act according to their own experience  —   they see things, they experience things, they talk to their neighbours. And they feel the picture being presented in the media is not entirely accurate. Many people think the media and the politicians have merged together to make people believe that it is safe and sound to live here, and there are no problems. The media says immigration is always a positive thing because we have an ageing population and we need a young workforce to come from other countries. People don’t buy that picture 100 per cent. Living here you can see a lot of the crimes are committed by people originating abroad. Look at the unemployment here  —   you have 15 per cent in Malmo, which is twice the rest of Sweden. Of the number of people arrested and dragged into police stations, the majority are of foreign origin to be honest. There is an   of violent crimes committed by people from other countries. But you can’t fool people. And that’s why the Sweden Democrats are rising. It was 25 per cent last week, now it is 27. There is a debate happening, you see all of the refugees coming  …     but we don’t have apartments, housing for them. How do we provide schooling for them? And then you see the costs. There is a feeling we can’t afford an influx of immigrants.   ‘No go zones’ have been a hotly contested topic in the debate surrounding mass migration to Europe, with some activists strongly denying their existence. Whether the Swedish state admitted the fact or not, Elofsson said he’d experienced them in Malmo, and they made policing a more difficult job. He told Breitbart: We have a number of    in Sweden and they are expanding  …     police can go to these places, but you have to take precautions. Years ago you could go with two officers, no problem. Now you have to send four officers and two cars  —   if the fire brigade want to go, they have to take a police escort. They throw stones and try to stop the fireman from putting out fires. They sabotage the police cars. You can’t leave them unguarded  —   when you come back to it you find the windows smashed and the tyres deflated. It isn’t quite a   zone, but we have had to develop special routines to go there. The comments last week of serving Swedish Police officer Peter Springare, made in an exasperated Facebook post about what he called a clear link between migrants and crime levels are all the more unusual for having come from a serving officer. While he is now under investigation by his own force for “incitement to racial hatred” he at least has the support of one Swedish academic who too has spoken out. As reported by Breitbart London Thursday, Criminology Professor Leif GW Persson appeared on a Swedish television and said “There is a strong prevalence of criminal immigrants. It is so obvious when it comes to crimes of this nature. Very serious violent crime  …     Yes, I have made the same observation  …     anyone with eyes to see can know who is doing these kinds of actions”.

That book is about the rise of a certain segment of a   group of people who despised the Clintons and used three women, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp to try and tear him down. The Toobin book is amazing. And there are a lot of bizarre crimes within that book that you can highlight. ” “But the show isn’t really about Hillary Clinton, it really is about the other women.

J Simpson murder trial. The     swept the Emmys and Golden Globes. Murphy said season two will tackle Hurricane Katrina and season three will focus on the 1997 assassination of Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace. “We’re striking while the iron’s hot,” Murphy says of the   filming schedule. “But that was largely due to actors’ availability.

Jeff Sessions’ nomination hearing is expected to begin next week, amid fierce opposition from progressive groups. Breitbart News previously reported that Chicago ended 2016 with nearly 800 homicides for the year. The Chicago Tribune reports that there were a total of 779 homicides between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2016, an increase of nearly 300 homicides over 2015 figures. And there were a 4, 385 shootings  —   fatal and   combined  —   in   Chicago during 2016. The response to this carnage has been business as usual. The Tribune summed up the response to Chicago’s rise in homicides by suggesting there are “few answers” for curtailing the violence. It has long been known that one of the biggest problems in the status quo response to Chicago gun crime is the lackadaisical approach to prosecuting individuals who violate federal gun laws in the city. The NRA made this very point in Amercia’s 1st Freedom in August 2015: In 2014 in Chicago, over 2, 500 people were shot —  nearly 400 of them fatally —  and police seized more than 6, 252 guns. Yet out of those 6, 252 guns seized, Fardon’s federal prosecutors saw fit to pursue just 62 weapons prosecutions. In other words, for every 100 guns police seized, federal prosecutors made just one prosecution. With nearly 800 homicides in   Chicago last year, the  ’s Cox labels the lackluster response to death upon death as “immoral” and posits Sessions’ confirmation as the means to reverse the lack of prosecutions for gun law violations.

He continued:  It is the policy of the Department of Justice to reduce crime in America, and addressing violent crime must be a special priority. With crime rates rising, this is not an easy task as all professionals know. But, we do have strong evidence that aggressive prosecutions of federal laws can be effective in combatting crime. Our Department’s experience over decades shows these prosecutions can help save lives. Sessions reference to rising murder is drawn from the FBI’s 2015 crime report. The report revealed a 10. 8 percent increase in murders from 2014 to 2015 —  the largest increase in a single year since 1971 —  and a 3. 9 percent increase in violent crime overall. Major cities were hit with a staggering 21. 6 percent increase in murders, another FBI report found. Under Obama, a sudden reversal of a   decline in violent crime took place in 2015 after be pushed his “  ” campaign against state and local police following the August 2014 riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Sessions has now directed the 94 federal U. S. Attorney’s Offices to work with state and local law enforcement to “specifically identify the criminals responsible for significant violent crime in their districts,” and ensure they are prosecuted. Sessions specifically cited drug trafficking as a major contributor to violent crime, urging prosecutors to take down dealers and their enterprises. “[M]any violent crimes are driven by drug trafficking and drug trafficking organizations. For this reason, disrupting and dismantling those drug organizations through prosecutions under the Controlled Substances Act can drive violent crime down,” he said. The memo also indicates Sessions will demand prosecutors seek mandatory minimum sentences, Politico reports. Sessions’ approach is a complete   from the Obama administration’s efforts to minimize penalties against drug traffickers. For example, Obama launched an unprecedented effort to slash drug traffickers’ sentences, many of whom are armed convicts: He commuted over 1, 700 federal prisoners’ sentences before leaving office, saying it was “the right thing to do” and “we all make mistakes. ” Using revised sentencing guidelines, the Obama administration also released 30, 000 convicts from federal prison. In 2013, former U. S. Attorney General Eric Holder told prosecutors not to mention the weight of drugs seized from traffickers when officials were filing crime reports. The purpose was to avoid triggering the strong sentences. The soft approach was bad news for communities, but good news for traffickers eager to get back into the   business: Recidivism rates for those charged with drug crimes stand at 77 percent, according to a Justice Department study commissioned under Holder. While the media uses the term “drug offenders” to paint a sympathetic picture of dealers, there are almost no cases of simple possession in federal courts, as Sessions explained during a May press conference. Nearly all, of 99. 5 percent those incarcerated in federal prison on   charges, were found guilty of trafficking illicit drugs. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent enterprise “inseparable from violent victimization” and the ravages of addiction. Over 47, 000 people died from   deaths in 2014 alone. Heroin overdose deaths have more than tripled between 2010 and 2015. Immigration also fueled this surge of   : Nearly all of the heroin used in the U. S. is brought across the border by   traffickers. “By consistently identifying the leading violent offenders in our communities and employing all available tools to hold them accountable, we will combat violent crime,” Sessions added. The Obama administration’s efforts to slash the prison population is directly linked to the massive   death toll, according to one federal prosecutor. Read Sessions’ memo here.

10805,10805,29541,How Federal Agencies Keep Americans in the Dark About Crime Statistics,Breitbart,Katie McHugh and Neil Munro,2017-04-16,2017.0,4.0,,"The Department of Justice should keep the public informed about the results of former President Barack Obama’s decision to grant early releases to 1, 715 convicts, says a former federal prosecutor. [“What [Attorney General Jeff] Sessions Justice Department needs to do now is track the hundreds of fellows who got these pardons and commutations,” said former federal prosecutor Bill Otis. “With overall recidivism rates for drug offenses already being 77 percent, I think we have a pretty good idea, but [the public] should get specifics: How many of these guys   what’s the nature of the new crime were there related violent crimes in the mix as well and how many victims (including but not limited to addicts and overdose victims) were there?”  But only the Department of Justice has the manpower and access to raw data needed to detail and analyze Obama’s     process which released a record 1, 715 convicts back into Americans’ neighborhoods. At least one other group has tried to gauge the impact of President George W. Bush’s pardons —  but that group had to hire three researchers to assemble only some of the data that the federal government has at its fingertips but does not share. Since January, President Donald Trump has already taken some steps to increase federal transparency by forcing agencies to release data about crime by illegal aliens. For Otis, this change is a good example of what officials should do with information about Obama’s commutations. “It may be helpful to have some kind of interagency standard or oversight body to ensure the public has reasonable access to the data it paid for,” consistent with privacy rules, said Jason Richwine, a public policy expert who studies government data to gauge the impact of policy alternatives. “When the government publishes [only] selected statistics from the restricted data, we get answers only to the questions that the government thinks are important —  not necessarily the same questions that the public wants (or needs) to be answered,” he said. “It’s almost always a good idea for the feds to be more transparent,” said Otis. “The sheer size of the federal government makes it hard for citizens to know what’s going on,” Otis wrote, adding: The feds should also be, not just more transparent, but quicker to release crime data. Because the present release procedures are so slow, liberals were able to deny for many months —  if not close to a year —  the crime spike that began at the end of 2014, and to dismiss it as just ‘scattered reports’ or ‘a bunch of scaremonger anecdotes. In  January, as he was preparing to leave the White House, Obama claimed “there is no growing crime wave,” despite the crime wave that has killed an extra 1, 500 Americans in 2015 and 2016. Sheltered by the embargo on government data that could have debunked his denial, Obama used his pardon power to shorten sentences for 1, 715 criminals, including traffickers of deadly drugs. Many of those who received clemency are also violent felons. For example, Obama commuted the sentence of a   drug trafficker sentenced for involvement in his   ’s shooting death —  and Sherman Ray Meirovitz will be back on the streets in June instead of serving out a life sentence. Obama freed a former armed cocaine dealer onto Virginia’s streets in March, along with a former armed Philadelphia crack cocaine dealer, plus a former armed California meth trafficker. Obama also justified his   release by claiming racial disparities in the criminal justice system. “About one in every 35 African American men, one in every 88 Latino men is serving time right now. Among white men, that number is one in 214,” Obama said in a 2015 NAACP speech. He continued: For nonviolent drug crimes, we need to lower long mandatory minimum sentences —  or get rid of them entirely. Give judges some discretion around nonviolent crimes so that, potentially, we can steer a young person who has made a mistake in a better direction. We should pass a sentencing reform bill through Congress this year. We need to ask prosecutors to use their discretion to seek the best punishment, the one that’s going to be most effective, instead of just the longest punishment. We should invest in alternatives to prison, like drug courts and treatment and probation programs. Obama’s White House stated that 60 percent of those incarcerated in federal prison were black or Latino but declined to reveal critical details. The   claim deeply shaped Congress’s debate over crime in 2015 and 2016, when Obama and his deputies tried to pass the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015 (SCRA) which would have slashed mandatory minimums for drug traffickers. The bill’s language, however, reached far beyond the small number of people convicted solely on drug offenses.  Sessions, who is now the U. S. Attorney General, noted in May 2016 that there are “virtually no cases of simple possession” in the federal courts. Nearly all, or 99. 5 percent, of those incarcerated in federal prison for   “nonviolent drug crimes” are convicted on trafficking charges. The bill stalled in the Senate as a handful of Republican senators, including Arkansas’ Tom Cotton and Florida’s Marco Rubio, publicly opposed the legislation, and GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump campaigned on a platform promising “law and order. ” Defeated by data, Obama sought another path to reducing the federal prison population. “As was so often the case, Obama simply took the law into his own hands. Had Congress thought its prior drug laws were too stringent, it could have, by legislation, given retroactive effect to any lighter sentences it wanted,” Otis explained. “But it didn’t —  the push for sentencing ‘reform’ fizzled. Frustrated with Congress’s refusal to adopt even more of his   agenda, Obama just acted unilaterally. ” Now that Obama has provided clemency to 1, 715 prisoners, his actions will have   ramifications, Otis warned: I think there are two   effects of Obama’s mass clemencies. One is to send the message that we’re just not that serious anymore in dealing with drug traffickers, and that we think the real problem is that American is too callous and punitive (and racist?) —  not that drug dealers are too unfeeling towards the lives they damage while trying to make a quick buck  …     The other   effect will be simply to exacerbate the heroin overdose crisis that’s been escalating for at least a decade. Why we become lenient toward drug dealers at exactly the moment the dangers of drugs have reached a shocking level is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. Obama undertook his   campaign at a time when over 47, 000 Americans died from drug overdose deaths in 2014, including 28, 647 from opioid overdoses, and   overdose deaths tripled between 2010 and 2015. The CDC found over that a staggering 500, 000 people died from drug overdoses from 2000 to 2014. It is difficult to track criminals who received commutations, especially when the government is reluctant to share or even collect important statistics, as several experts explained to Breitbart News. Without clear and detailed government data, activists and critics of government policies must rely on outside surveys, indirect or   data, often decorated by anecdotes. A Justice Department investigation into the makeup of the commutations would need to compare the makeup of the commuted population, versus the current prison population, versus the general population. Unfortunately, much of the needed data is not collected and the existing statistics sometimes raise more questions than they answer. For example, the Uniform Crime Reports, a compilation of street crime reports collected from 18, 000 different sources published annually by the FBI, has five race categories: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. “White” in the UCR’s case includes all Latinos —  and the Latino population in the U. S. stood at roughly 57 million in 2015. Blurring racial and ethnic categories makes obtaining a complete picture difficult. Since nearly all of the heroin used in the U. S. is brought across the border by Mexican traffickers, who are nearly always illegal aliens, there is an immigration angle to Obama’s sentence commutations as well, made more opaque by the “muddled” data collected by the feds. For example, a report by the CATO Institute recently claimed that Trump’s new VOICE program was unwarranted because immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than similar Americans. “Our headline finding is that both illegal immigrants and legal immigrants have incarceration rates far below those of   Americans —  at 0. 85 percent, 0. 47 percent, and 1. 53 percent, respectively,” claimed author Alex Nowrasteh. However, the study, titled “Criminal Immigrants: Their Numbers, Demographics, and Countries of Origin,” relies on extrapolations from the American Community Survey, not on actual data from the Department of Justice. That lack of DOJ data skews the CATO report because it cannot measure how many migrants were sent home before they could   like many American criminals who stay in the country to commit more crimes. That immigrant vs. American comparison problem might be reduced if the federal government released data showing the share of   criminals in jail under   offenses. But, said author Alex Nowrasteh, “that data is not in the    …     If you have it, please share it. ” The group ProPublica tried to study the patterns in the pardons (not commutations) approved by President George W. Bush. The group recognized the lack of DOJ data and launched an enormous undertaking by at least two authors and three researchers, and extensive data analysis, to show that 494 requests for pardons were submitted, but only 189 were partly or fully approved. Of those 189 pardons, many were for   crimes, while only a small proportion was for drug offenses. “Accounting for the effects of these variables did not eliminate the strong influence of race on getting a pardon [and] [a]fter testing all available variables, we found that whites were still nearly four times as likely to be pardoned as minorities overall,” said the 2011 report, which explains the complexities caused by the lack of public federal data. President Bush relied almost exclusively on recommendations from the Office of the Pardon Attorney inside the Justice Department. The data thus provide an opportunity to assess the office’s impact on final pardon decisions. Through a Freedom of Information Act request, ProPublica obtained the names of petitioners who were denied pardons during Bush’s two terms —  1, 729 individuals. The names of 189 petitioners who received pardons came from the pardon office website. ProPublica pulled a random sample of 500 names from the combined list  …     For all those in the sample, ProPublica staff and freelance researchers searched public records or made phone contacts to gather demographic data such as age, race, gender and marital status. Researchers gathered sentencing information from federal court records and FOIA requests, and searched other records to collect data on bankruptcies, liens, financial judgments and any additional criminal history  …     We conducted a binary logistic regression. The dependent variable was whether the petitioner received a pardon. We tested all other available variables against the outcome. In the end, variables that we included in the analysis were:   …     Hispanic petitioners are classified as white in most federal court and prison records. To identify Hispanics in our sample, we relied on Hispanic surname or race as designated in other public records  …     The government’s habit of hoarding original data complicates many policy debates, said experts. When the government shares its data, the public can understand existing patterns and data, crime expert Heather McDonald told Breitbart News. For example, she said: [In] New York City blacks make up 53 percent of all New York police department pedestrian stops, but blacks are only 23 percent of the city’s population. To a naïve observer, that disparity in police activity looks like racism. What you need to know is that blacks commit 75 percent of all shootings in New York City and 70 percent of all robberies. By contrast, whites are 34 percent of the population but they commit less than two percent of all shootings and less than four percent of all robberies. Whites make up nine percent of all police pedestrian stops. So blacks are actually under stopped compared to what their crime rates would predict and whites are over stopped compared to what their crime rates would predict. The extra knowledge can help resolve public debates, such as the controversy over race and arrests rates, she explained. “The big fallacy of all   activism is to ignore the fact that policing today is   and police go where people are most being victimized and that is in minority neighborhoods. But the public is, by and large, clueless about how vast the disparities in criminal offending are,” she said. “The federal government could take the lead in educating the public about policing and crime. ” On immigration issues, the federal government hides data about the scale of   programs, such as the   program, and it hides data about green card holders, said Steven Camarota, research director at the   Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). Similarly, the federal government has muddled data regarding repatriations, he said, adding: “This is how the Obama administration made [the number of] deportations look higher. ” The federal government does have data from the states about the number of illegal aliens in U. S. jails, but it only releases data about the annual number of hours spent by all illegal alien prisoners, he continued. The data about cumulative hours is released via federal reports about federal funding for state jails that house illegal aliens. “It is not enough to know that Arizona says they had a million hours of aliens in prison in the last year,” he told Breitbart News. “You want to know what that is a percentage of the total” number of hours and prisoners, he said. Without the   “microcode’ data, he said, “we can’t do our own analysis. ” “I would like to know all the different categories of people among those arrested,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the CIS. “How many have protected status? How many have green cards?” she asked. “They won’t even tell us how many are ” she said, adding: “I know they can do a breakdown because I’ve seen it in the past. ” The Department of Homeland Security should reveal far more of the data is keeps secret, said Vaughan, including: “The number of releases of illegal aliens from ICE custody, the number of people who are caught and released by the Border Patrol, how about the number of people who are here on exchange visas who are working as opposed to studying? The number on [Optional Practical Training] approvals  …     [and] what ‘training’ they’re doing and the number of terror convicts who are foreign born. ” For example, the agency should release data about ‘IRS tax returns which are filed by people who provide two different [identification] numbers  …     how many times are returns filed with a number that is used multiple times  …     how many employers are reporting information that includes Social Security Numbers that are used by multiple employees,” she said. The Department of Education should collect and release data about how private universities treat applications by people from various racial and ethnic backgrounds, said Roger Clegg, president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. “That’s not something that private universities are willing to divulge,” he told Breitbart News. Until the federal government chooses to accurately collect and then publicize such crime data, Americans seeking the truth about dangerous criminals released into their communities will continue to be left in the dark. “Data about Obama’s commutations would be especially useful, for a reason that’s easy to see: They were given out in record numbers, vastly more than any President at least since Eisenhower,” Otis told Breitbart News. “Why was that? Maybe we should examine the facts to find out. It could be that there were so many more harmless or   people in federal prison when Obama was President, but, if so, let’s put the facts on the table. ” “In deciding the real basis for Obama’s nearly unprecedented clemency binge, of course it would be useful for the public (and the press, if it had any interest) to be able to see more of the story behind the clemency decisions,” he said. “One other thing: Liberals are forever telling us that we need ‘ ’ policy, only they seldom seem to welcome the data,” he added.

If FBI director Comey is unwilling to investigate these illegal leaks, Buchanan suggests a special counsel should. [From Buchanan’s latest column:  Is the FBI investigating the intelligence sources who committed felonies by illegally disclosing information about the Trump campaign? Comey would not commit to investigate these leaks, though this could involve criminal misconduct within his own FBI. Again, the only known crimes committed by Americans during and after the campaign are the leaks of security secrets by agents of the intel community, colluding with the Fourth Estate, which uses the First Amendment to provide cover for criminal sources, whom they hail as “whistleblowers. ” Indeed, if there was no surveillance of Trump of any kind, where did all these stories come from, which their reporters attributed to “intelligence sources”? Attorney General Jeff Sessions has recused himself from any role in the Russian hacking scandal. But the Justice Department should demand that the FBI put the highest priority on investigating the deep state and its journalistic collaborators in the sabotage of the Trump presidency.

They’ve ramped up their fake news activities to prove how wrong we all are, and their top weapon is fake hate crimes. ” “America has a problem with fake hate crimes. The left is always searching for the next big outrage, and sometimes when the pressure gets too high, they just decide to make them up,” he continued. “That is basically how the UVA rape fantasy that ran in Rolling Stone came about by the way. This trend has just accelerated since the election. Fake attacks on Muslim women seem to be in vogue right now. But it isn’t a new trend. I wrote an article in May 2016 that documented 100 fake hate crimes in the last decade. 100 of them! And surely there were more that just didn’t make it into the public eye. ” “I bring this up because Colorado Springs is part of the list. In 2015, threats were left outside of a predominantly black church referencing the KKK and a second one says ‘Black men beware, you are the target’,” MILO declared. “There’s just one problem  …    . This is the evil racist local police found behind the messages. ” In Scooby Doo unmasking fashion, MILO displayed the image of the black perpetrator onto the projector. “Woops, it’s a black guy!” he announced. “Sadly, this is part of an increasing trend in the US towards sensational but untrue stories. Fake hate crimes are the original fake news. ” “I mentioned the UVA rape case, which was a complete fabrication happily carried by the leftist media.

[West Yorkshire Police are reportedly investigating 179 new sex crimes involving 165 suspects in the small mill town, described as the nation’s ‘capital’ of child grooming.  Situated just outside Bradford, Keighley has a population of 56, 000, including more than 12, 000 Muslims, and the town boasts eight mosques. Last year 12 men were jailed for more than 140 years between them for the abuse of one    girl in Keighley, who the gang repeatedly raped over a period of 13 months   —   on one occasion five men “lining up” and taking it in turns to abuse her. A report into the case found the girl was known to police and services but let down, just as in the Rochdale scandal recently dramatised by the BBC. Local MP, Conservative Kris Hopkins, has warned that the town is “top of the list” for ‘Asian’ grooming gangs targeting white children to be sexually abused. “I am very well aware that there are numerous white paedophiles out there and they should be dealt with just as harshly,” he told the Telegraph and Argus after the Keighley gang were jailed. “But the sick model of organised groups of Asian men grooming young white girls to be sexually abused remains a blight at the heart of many communities across this country. “And sadly, Keighley is at the top of the list. ” Serious sexual abuse including the rape of vulnerable teenage girls took place in Rochdale between 2005 and 2013, with girls as young as 14 plied with vodka, threatened with violence and passed around men for sex. In February, four members of the gang failed in their bid to appeal moves by the government to strip them of their British passports. The UK’s most senior immigration judge, Mr Justice Bernard McCloskey, warned   lawyers were using tactics of obstructing the courts and time wasting in their bid to help the child sex grooming gang escape attempts to deport them."

[The new report from the BKA states that in 2016 there was a total of 295, 000 crimes that involved immigrants as suspects, up 90, 000 from 2015 when there were 205, 000. The police say that the crimes counted did not include migrant specific crimes like illegal entry into Germany or staying in the country illegally Die Welt reports.  The three most cited crimes that involved immigrants were counterfeiting which accounted for 29 percent of all the crimes, theft at 26 percent, and violence including bodily harm at 24 percent. The BKA said there were 450 cases in which migrants had attempted to kill another person, with 66 murder suspects and a total of 82 victims. The twelve victims of the Berlin Christmas market terror attack in December committed by Tunisian asylum seeker Anis Amri were also counted in the statistics. In   of the cases of attempted murder or homicide, the victims were immigrants themselves with 59 victims coming from migrant backgrounds while other victims included five EU citizens, two   citizens and 16 German nationals. Breitbart London has reported on several cases, primarily in and around asylum homes, in which migrant men have beaten and sometimes even murdered family members such as their own wives. The BKA defines “immigrants” in the report as anyone who is either an asylum seeker, a person with refugee status, an illegal immigrant or failed asylum seekers who are allowed to stay in the country. A spokeswoman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said that the government was working on a full report that will also include criminal statistics from the regional governments as well. Several regions in Germany have already released migrant crime statistics and all have shown a drastic rise in migrant crime. In Munich police have noted that almost half of the criminal suspects in the Bavarian city are “ . ” In the German capital of Berlin, the senate has launched a formal inquiry into why migrant crime rates are so high in the city. The Berlin crime statistics showed that 13 percent of the migrant population in the city were suspects in various crimes, compared to the German population in which only 6 percent were suspects in crimes.   and Bavaria have both expressed concerns with the growing migrant crime trend. Last month   State Criminal Police Office (LKA) president Ralf Michelfelder said, “we are very worried about the rise in violence by asylum seekers. ”  Follow Chris Tomlinson on Twitter at @TomlinsonCJ or email at ctomlinson@breitbart. com,      "

Here are a sampling of crime headlines from the first two weeks of 2017: Lewis declared on Friday he will not attend Trump’s inauguration. “I don’t see the   as a legitimate president,” Lewis had told NBC News’ Chuck Todd earlier. Revealing authentic emails from Democrats, including speeches given by Hillary Clinton about her “dream” of open borders, unfairly “destroyed” her candidacy, Lewis complained. “I think the Russians participated in having this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton. I don’t plan to attend the Inauguration,” he said. “I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians, and others, that helped him get elected. That’s not right. That’s not fair. That’s not the open, democratic process. ”"
12479,12480,31216,Chicago Police Board Chair: Windy City Needs Federal Help to Turn Tide on Crime - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2017-01-08,2017.0,1.0,,"During a January 7 interview on NPR, Chicago Police Board Chairwoman Lori Lightfoot said Chicago cannot end the city’s violence alone  —   they need federal help. [Chicago’s Lightfoot “also chairs Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s Police Accountability Task Force. ”  According to NPR, Lightfoot said: We need to have more federal gun prosecutions in Chicago. Our federal partners from the U. S. attorney’s office, the ATF, the FBI need to be much more invested in this overall strategy. Chicago Police Department cannot tackle this issue by itself. Lighfoot’s statement came less than a week after   Donald Trump tweeted: Chicago murder rate is record setting  —   4, 331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can’t do it he must ask for Federal help!  —   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017,  Think about it  —   Chicago saw over 4, 300 shootings for the year and nearly 800 murders, yet the left greeted Trump’s tweet with disdain. That disdain was epitomized by Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, who used a CNN   to claim: As with many of the  ’s tweets, we are forced to speculate as to the content of that federal “help,” but certainly Trump’s campaign rhetoric gives us plenty of evidence to understand his approach to criminal justice policy and more broadly, his views of people of color. Thus far, he has proposed a crackdown on communities that have suffered gravely from violence as well as a crisis of confidence in policing. This    strategy is fueled by Trump’s own ignorance of the communities most impacted by violence and his inability to account for the political and social causes that create violence. Maybe Van Cleve should have consulted Lightfoot before belittling Trump’s offer of federal help. Had she done so, she would have seen that Lightfoot also mentioned the problems resulting from a lack of confidence in policing. But Lightfoot suggested these problems cannot be used as an excuse to continue down a path which obviously isn’t working: In our history in this country, the police have been used as a bludgeon against communities of color, particularly black folks in the segregated South and frankly in the North in enforcing Jim Crow laws. We know that history, so this is not an easy and delicate topic. But it’s one that we have to dive in, we have to embrace because I said before I’m 100 percent convinced that if we don’t take steps in each other’s direction to try to address this strained and fractured relationship, those communities that are most in need, those people that are most desperate for quality and effective policing, they’re going to be further victimized by the failure in that relationship. A quick aside  —   If Lightfoot and Van Cleve really want to be honest about the past, they should be sure to point out that Democrats were the authors of Jim Crow and the authors of southern segregation. These things, along with gun control, were part of the Democrats’ plan for communities of color.

S. Marine Corps and Navy following a nude photo sharing scandal. [“An interim revision to Navy regulations prohibits Navy and Marine Corps personnel from posting intimate photos ‘if the person making the distribution or broadcast does so without legal justification or excuse,’” reported the Navy Times on Wednesday. “The statute details three conditions that will be considered a violation of Navy regulations, including if images are broadcast or transmitted: ‘with the intent to realize personal gain with the intent to humiliate, harm, harass, intimidate, threaten, or coerce the depicted person or with reckless disregard as to whether the depicted person would be humiliated, harmed, intimidated, threatened, or coerced,’ the regs read. ”  The new rules, which were reportedly signed off by Acting Navy Secretary Sean Stackley, are also set to begin immediately. “It is characterized as interim until the next edition of Navy regulations is printed,” the Navy Times explained, adding that those who ignore the new regulations could be charged with “failure to obey a lawful order. ” “The addition of Article 1168 ‘Nonconsensual distribution or broadcasting of an image’ to Navy Regulations serves to underscore leadership’s commitment to eliminating degrading behaviors that erode trust and weaken the Navy and Marine Corps Team,” said Rear Adm. Dawn Cutler in a statement. “It provides commanders another tool to maintain good order and discipline by holding Sailors and Marines accountable for inappropriate conduct in the nonconsensual sharing of intimate imagery. “This article adds the potential charge of Article 92 ‘Failure to obey [an] order or regulation’ to the possible charges that can be used against an alleged perpetrator,” he continued. “Each case of alleged misconduct will be evaluated on its own facts and circumstances. ” In March, it was reported that both the NCIS and the Pentagon had launched an investigation into the scandal, which saw the distribution of “explicit photos of current and former female Marines and other service members” through a Facebook group. “A private Facebook group called ‘Marines United’ contained a link to a Google Drive folder, where the photos were being stored,” reported CNN last month. “Members on the site solicited others to submit photos of women without their knowledge. The cloud storage folder has been removed at the request of the military. ” “It was not clear to the Defense Department how many current and former Marines may be involved in potential wrongdoing,” they continued. “A former Marine originally brought the matter to the attention of the Marine Corps last month. ” Since the beginning of the scandal, the private images have spread across different parts of the internet and were even reportedly found up for sale on the dark web earlier this month.

12690,12691,31427,Tancredo - Illegal Aliens and Violent Crime: Some Amazing Facts - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Tancredo,2017-03-12,2017.0,3.0,,"Take a look at the crime statistics for just one state, Texas. A 2017 report by the Texas Department of Public Safety reveals that over the period from June 1, 2011 to February 28, 2017, the 215, 000 criminal aliens who were booked into Texas jails were collectively charged with 566, 000 offenses, including 1, 167 homicides and 6, 098 sexual assaults, with a total of 257, 000 convictions. [By the way, Texas has less than half the criminal alien jail and prison population of California, which has over 100, 000 criminal aliens occupying facilities supported by California taxpayers. (For 2009 incarceration numbers for each state, see Appendix III of the 2011 GAO report, here.)  It’s no secret that progressive politicians in hundreds of cities and counties are opposing the Trump administration initiatives to end   “sanctuary” policies. What those politicians never talk about is the fact that those policies continue to allow tens of thousands of criminal aliens to go free instead of facing deportation proceedings as prescribed by federal law. According to a summary report on sanctuary policies from Federation for American Immigration Reform and numerous media reports, it’s not just San Francisco, New York and Chicago that are obstructing federal deportation of violent criminals. About 300 local city and county jurisdictions have adopted official policies to refuse cooperation with immigration enforcement in open violation of federal law. And California is not the only place with a statewide sanctuary policy. For a map of principal sanctuary jurisdictions, go here. You might think that Texas is a state with uniform cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, but you would be wrong. The capital city of Austin recently announced it will defy President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security and the Governor of Texas by continuing its sanctuary policies. Yes, there’s a new sheriff in town, and citizens will soon have new protections if the new federal policies are followed. President Trump’s January 25 executive order is only the beginning of the fight, and we can expect the ACLU and other open borders advocates will challenge new enforcement policies in federal courts. Here is the political reality. Sanctuary policies across the country are an important pillar of the “Obama Legacy,” so progressives and the leaders of the Democratic Party are not going to abandon that legacy. This commitment by progressives makes immigration enforcement and the end of local sanctuary policies far more of a political issue than in the past. Until Obama’s election in 2008, there were only a handful of sanctuary cities across the nation, but the number skyrocketed after 2008 and now numbers over 300 according to a recent report from the Center for Immigration Studies. A 2016 report by the Inspector General at the U. S. Department of Justice found 155 jurisdictions that limit or restrict cooperation with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. But as we said, there is a new sheriff in town  —   and his deputies have been busy. Trump’s January 25 Executive Order was followed on February 20 by a Department of Homeland Security Memorandum titled, “Enforcement of the Immigration Laws to Serve the National Interest. ” It is well worth reading in full. This directive has many features that have already been welcomed as a breath of fresh air in the ranks of the officers of the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One section of the DHS Memorandum that has been largely overlooked by the media could well serve as a giant spotlight on the devastation in local communities caused by sanctuary policies. A 2011 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report revealed that the typical criminal alien inmate in federal prisons had been arrested 12 times for various offenses. On page 17 that GAO report is a summary of the arrest data for the criminal aliens in state and federal jails: They were arrested for a total of about 2. 9 million offenses, averaging about 12[each]  …     slightly lower than the 13 offenses per criminal alien we reported in 2005. The Texas DPS report cited above said criminal aliens arrested over that   period had been arrested for an average of 2. 5 crimes. Taking the average number of crimes committed by ARRESTED criminal aliens as five, and extrapolating from the data on the total number of criminal alien inmates in state and local jails in 2016, the approximately 300, 000 criminal aliens in state and local jails are responsible for over 1, 500, 00 crimes. In Colorado, the 2, 039 criminal aliens in the state prison system in 2016 were 14. 7 percent of a prison population of 13, 873. The 2016 annual report on the criminal aliens in the Colorado state prison system is here. The 14. 7 percent can be easily calculated from the 2, 039 inmates in a total prison population of 13, 873 found in this document. This 14. 7 percent is over four times the illegal alien population share of total state population, estimated at 200, 000 in 2013 by the Pew Hispanic Center. It is true that even under Obama’s lax policies on enforcement and deportations, local ICE offices routinely intercepted criminal alien felons being released from state prisons and deported the most violent among them. But it was a far different story for the thousands of criminals released from LOCAL jails in dozens of sanctuary jurisdictions, where federal ICE detainers were not being honored and violent criminals were routinely released to commit other crimes. Even the   Denver Post could not ignore two recent cases where an ICE detainer request was ignored and illegal aliens were released by the Denver jail and then arrested for homicide only weeks later. One case was a    accident that left a young woman dead, and the second was a brutal murder at a light rail stop. Unfortunately, our nation’s intrepid journalists are not routinely reporting on the thousands of crimes committed by criminal aliens who have been in police custody but then released because of sanctuary policies. It is conceivable that at least a half million serious crimes annually could be prevented if all illegal aliens convicted of felonies were deported  —   and then prevented from returning by effective border controls."
12874,12875,31611,Teachers’ Union: ’Promote’ LGBT Lifestyles to Two Year Olds to Stop Hate Crime - Breitbart,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,2017-04-18,2017.0,4.0,,"Transgender lifestyles and   relationships should be ‘promoted’ to children as young as two to reduce hate crime, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) has said. [Delegates at the union’s national conference in Cardiff on Monday voted for its members to teach about ‘LGBT+’ issues and lifestyles to toddlers starting from nursery school.  Teachers bemoaned a “lack of policies which promote LGBT+ within schools” which they allege has a “significant negative impact” on the   of students and teachers who are homosexual or transgender. It was revealed last month that primary schools will likely be legally obliged to teach pupils about   couples as part of the mandatory relationships curriculum that is due to begin from 2019. But the NUT says the amendment to the Children and Social Work Bill doesn’t go far enough, calling for “  content” on the subject at an even younger age, and for secondary school pupils to be taught more about safe sex in gay relationships. NUT executive committee member Annette Pryce slammed a “right wing, religious lobby” which she blamed for having prevented ministers from proposing a more “inclusive” agenda for sex education. “Generations of young LGBT+ people who have been failed by the system are still not told explicitly in the law that their lives are important too,” Pryce said. They urged ministers to make proposed sex and relationship education (SRE) “inclusive” to so that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender students “are told explicitly in the law that their lives are important too”. “It is high time that PSHE and SRE  —   including LGBT+ education  —   is recognised as an essential part of the school curriculum,” NUT general secretary Kevin Courtney told the conference. “It is important for a modern   society to understand and embrace differences within our communities. “The alternative is many pupils being isolated, bullied or misinformed and, for many, there is an impact on health and   that can last well beyond school years,” he warned. While teaching sex and relationships is not compulsory for nurseries, it is thought that NUT members working in daycare facilities for two to    could introduce it voluntarily. The Church of England announced that they support the introduction of statutory sex education in schools, and Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has previously said that children should be taught to “revere” and “honour” LGBT people despite the Church’s   teaching that homosexual acts are a sin. Chief executive at Christian Concern Andrea Williams, however, argued that teaching sex and relationships education (SRE) to    would be “devastating” and risks “robbing them of their innocence”."
13220,13221,31957,Another Hate Crime Hoax: Church Organist Admits He Vandalized His Own Church with Trump and Nazi Slogans,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2017-05-05,2017.0,5.0,,"An Indiana community was shocked after a local church was vandalized with Nazi slogans and Donald Trump graffiti, but now police say it is a hate crime hoax and the church was not attacked by an outsider. They have charged the congregation’s own organist, a Hillary supporter and gay activist, for the crime. [After St. David’s Episcopal Church in Bean Blossom, Indiana, was vandalized, many suspected they were targeted by KKK members or a Nazi group. Members of the church urged police to investigate the incident as a hate crime, WTHR Channel 13 reported.  But after an investigation, the Brown County prosecuting attorney’s office shocked the congregation by charging the church’s own organist,    George Nathaniel Stang of Bloomington. It was Stang who first reported the vandalism to police last November only days after last year’s presidential election. It was immediately thought to be a hate crime because the small Episcopal Church is a progressive congregation that welcomes gays. The graffiti spray painted on the church walls read “Heil Trump” and “Fag Church. ” But during their inquiries police quickly came to feel that the vandalism was done by someone familiar with the church and began looking at the crime as an inside job. After an investigation, police arrested Stang. The church organist allegedly admitted to the crime telling police he did it because he wanted to “mobilize a movement after being disappointed in and fearful of the outcome of the national election. ” In a   confession entered into court documents, Stand reportedly said he was trying to spark his congregation into activism. “I suppose I wanted to give local people a reason to fight for good, even if it was a false flag,” he wrote according to court records. “To be clear my actions were not motivated by hate for the church or its congregation. I, of course, realize now, this was NOT the way to go about inspiring activism. ” The Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis released a statement about the revelations calling Stang’s actions “profoundly misguided. ” “I was saddened to learn this morning that the vandalism of St. David’s Church in Bean Blossom was committed by the church’s organist, Nathan Stang, who has admitted to police that he spray painted hateful graffiti on the church last November in the wake of the presidential election. This was a hurtful, dishonest, and profoundly misguided action that stands against the values of the people of this diocese and the Episcopal Church, and we will continue to cooperate with the authorities who are pursuing this case.

13240,13241,31977,Blue State Blues: Hate Crime in the Chicago Obama Created,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2017-01-06,2017.0,1.0,,"Next week, President Barack Obama will travel to Chicago to deliver a farewell address. Though Obama built his political career there, it is a strange setting for a valediction. [No place better represents Obama’s failure as president than Chicago, which has suffered mightily on his watch. More people were murdered in Chicago last year than New York and Los Angeles combined, and this week’s   torture of a disabled white teenager is a reflection of the sad state of race relations.  Chicago is important to Obama’s biography, but it has been totally unimportant to his presidency. Aside from the occasional speech  —   such as a 2013 “economic” speech primarily devoted to gun control  —   Obama has barely done anything to help the city where he built his political persona. Not that he did much as a state senator, either. He had no achievements in Springfield until Senate Majority Leader Emil Jones decided to “make me a U. S. Senator” and gave Obama credit for others’ legislation. What impact State Sen. Obama had on Chicago was usually negative. While Obama’s team of consultants carefully managed his image in the Chicago press, and later the national media, it was the Boston Globe that exposed the rot in Obama’s housing record, where he shunted public funding to   private slumlords, who forced Chicago’s poor to live in “uninhabitable” conditions. (One of the main beneficiaries was Valerie Jarrett, still Obama’s most trusted and feared adviser.) When Obama won in 2008, he and his Chicago coterie left behind a city and a state mired in corruption and debt. Voters elected a reformist Republican, Bruce Rauner, who has been stymied by Chicago’s Mike Madigan, Speaker of the Illinois House. For eight years, Obama has had nothing to say about it, short of denying ties to disgraced former governor Rod Blagojevich and dispatching his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, to run for Chicago mayor, where he has been ineffective. Arguably, Obama made Chicago’s problems worse. There is some political science research to suggest that states do worse, not better, when their U. S. Senators ascend to more powerful committees. The anticipation of pork from Washington distorts   at home. So it is with Obama and Chicago. Until the Tea Party election of 2010, which put the U. S. House beyond Democrats’ reach for a decade, Illinois Democrats thought Obama would bail them out. Perhaps some of them still do. Meanwhile, Obama’s embrace of the Black Lives Matter movement has been a disaster for the city. As Mayor Emanuel said himself in 2015, commenting on the increased scrutiny of police  —   a result of BLM’s nationwide rise: “We have allowed our police department to get fetal and it is having a direct consequence   …     They have pulled back from the ability to interdict   …     they don’t want to be a news story themselves, they don’t want their career ended early, and it’s having an impact. ” The violence has been concentrated in the city’s poorer areas, but occasionally makes it to the suburbs, as it did in my home town of Skokie, where a swimmer on my old high school team was shot and killed in 2014. Bizarrely, the city’s violence has created a trendy “Chiraq”     which lives and breathes on social media  —   hence the Facebook live stream of a hate crime, accompanied by shouts of “fuck Donald Trump”  —   the refrain of a popular   song during the election. Chicago also made Obama a worse president  —   at least, the lessons he drew from Chicago, where he became convinced that a strong executive should dictate radical change rather than negotiating with the opposition. On Tuesday, he and the city will celebrate each other, and reminisce about that glorious victory speech in Grant Park. It was a moment to remember, because it was the peak for both. Aside from the Cubs and Blackhawks  —   teams Obama never supported  —   it has been downhill since. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

13514,13515,32251,CNN: Being an Illegal Alien ’Not Necessarily’ a Crime,Breitbart,John Binder,2017-02-28,2017.0,2.0,,"Illegal aliens who have overstayed their visas are “not necessarily” committing a crime just by remaining in the country illegally, according to CNN. [The cable network explained in a piece titled “Are undocumented immigrants committing a crime? Not necessarily” noting that they are not technically committing a crime by refusing to leave the U. S.:  Under federal law, it is a crime for anyone to enter into the U. S. without the approval of an immigration officer  —   it’s a misdemeanor offense that carries fines and no more than six months in prison. Many foreign nationals, however, enter the country legally every day on valid work or travel visas, and end up overstaying for a variety of reasons. But that’s not a violation of federal criminal law  —   it’s a civil violation that gets handled in immigration court proceedings. In fact, a 2006 study showed that roughly 45% of undocumented immigrants originally entered the US legally, but then remained in the country without authorization after their visas had expired. Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) Mark Krikorian, though, says visa   must commit a slew of federal crimes not only to remain in the U. S. but to work in the country as well. “If they’re working, most illegal immigrants who work, work on the books,” Krikorian told Breitbart Texas. “If that’s true, that means they produce false federal documents in order to work. You must show a driver’s license or Social Security number. ” “If the information you’re showing is false, that’s perjury,” Krikorian said. In fact, back in 2013, CIS specifically chronicled the “myth” about visa   being referred to by the mainstream media as “ ” residents of the U. S. Among many crimes, visa   may commit Social Security fraud, produce fraudulent and false statements, or impersonate a U. S. citizen in order to continue working. CNN does not mention these offenses —  instead ending the visa   debate on the notion that it is simply not a federal crime and therefore President Donald Trump should not be targeting these individuals for deportation. “So although there are more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U. S. they haven’t all committed a crime just by being in the country,” CNN writer Laura Jarrett concludes. Krikorian says CNN is using the “  a visa is not a federal crime” argument “as some kind of justification for giving them a pass. ” Despite the issue being a civil violation, Krikorian told Breitbart Texas that he questions whether or not   a visa should remain as such. The vast majority of illegal aliens who cross the U. S. Southern border are from Mexico and Central America. Visa   on the other hand, tend to be of Asian, Middle Eastern, and European descent, according to Krikorian. Keeping   as a civil violation is unfair, Krikorian says, because while border crossers are criminalized, visa matters are not. “That should be rectified,” Krikorian said. “Staying over 30 or 60 days after your visa expires should be a criminal offense. ” John Binder is a contributor for Breitbart Texas.

[The think tank’s chief executive Andy Cook said that regular contact with a father figure boosts cognitive skills such as reasoning and language development, and reduces criminal behaviour in children. He warned that fatherlessness in Britain is causing a “crisis” as nearly half of all children born today will not be living with both parents by the time they are 15.  “Over the last 40 years, the meteoric rise in family breakdown has blighted the lives of the poorest children the most. The relationship children have with their father affects their   how well they do at school, even whether they are able to form happy,   relationships as adults,” he told the Observer. Cook acknowledged that relationships would not always work out, but said a culture shift could minimise the frequency of families breaking down, arguing that fathers have an important role to play in a child’s upbringing. He said: “We need a societal shift in perspective from regarding fathers as a dispensable extra to recognising their value as a crucial pillar in a child’s life. ” David Cameron was due to release a flagship policy aimed at countering family breakdown within days of the European Union (EU) referendum, but it was was ditched when Theresa May took over as Prime Minister. The policy took the view that child poverty is about more than just money, highlighting family breakdown and other issues such as debt and addiction as contributors. Campaigners slammed the new definition for including value judgements, claiming that it risked “stigmatising” single parents. The Centre for Social Justice’s former chief executive Christian Guy, who served as David Cameron’s poverty advisor, said the previous strategy was aimed at starting a “parenting revolution”  —   telling the Observer that family instability “blighted lives in the poorest neighbourhoods”. Earlier this month Conservative MP Lucy Allan warned that children attending Fathers4Justice protests have been considered for the government’s   programme, Prevent, which was set up to deter “violent extremism” and terrorism. Campaigning for fairness towards men in Britain’s divorce courts, the fathers’ rights group have long maintained that contact with dads can provide major benefits to a child’s upbringing."

Callous leftists immediately began “trolling” the line, and the established media piled on. “We Asked ICE About the Prank Calls to Their   Hotline and They Kind of Lost Their Shit,” an   Fusion headline reads. “People Are Reporting Criminal (Space) Aliens To New ICE Hotline,” NPR giggles. “  trolling overloads ICE’s undocumented immigrant hotline with calls about space aliens,” said the CNN report, which approvingly quotes snarky leftists bragging on social media about attacking a program meant to help families stricken with grief and trying to navigate a massive federal bureaucracy. Despite the sneering, illegal aliens do in fact commit a great deal of crime. Illegal aliens commit “22 percent to 37 percent of all murders in the nation,” according to a retired San Jose, California detective. But Democrats and leftists slam anyone simply seeking information about the frequency and scale of illegal alien crime —  and they also ridicule the American victims of that crime. “I found these vicious acts of hate toward   and our ‘stolen lives’ families disturbing and callous,” Espinoza told Breitbart News. “Clearly, the perpetrators intended to obstruct government administration, and to delay, if not completely shut down, families trying to obtain the critical information and help they so badly need,” she said. ICE officials warned that harassing the hotline will hurt victims and families seeking justice. “The campaign to generate hoax calls is disrespectful to victims of crime and their families, and a waste of government resources,” one agency official told Breitbart News. “Secretary Kelly made clear in his announcement Wednesday that this phone line is to be dedicated for the use of victims seeking information and resources related to the civil immigration system. Tying up a hotline with hoax calls is neither an appropriate nor constructive way to express one’s opinions and it may prevent legitimate victims of crime from receiving the information and resources they seek. ” DHS and VOICE operate the   Information and Notification Exchange ( ) —  the automated, national system which sends automatic updates regarding custody information about a specific illegal alien charged with, or convicted of, a crime. The   service simply allows anyone, citizens or   to privately keep track of court appearances and release dates. Those who lost loved ones at the hands of illegal aliens have told Breitbart News in detail how difficult it is to seek justice for a child or spouse suddenly cut down because the government refused to enforce the nation’s routine immigration laws. For example, parents may wait years for a trial to take place, may be forced to hire an attorney out of their own pocket as they struggle to pay the bills while mired in grief, and then watch their child’s killer describe exactly how he murdered him while on the stand. “You’ve never been faced with the evil, and with the trauma,” Angel Mom Laura Wilkerson said on SiriusXM. Espinoza condemned the vindictive efforts to newly inflict pain on the victims of illegal alien crime. “As we have seen many times before, the intolerant left leads the way in the   of families who have already suffered enough from the radical policies of a radical Democrat party,” she said. “From working with our families for so many years through so many disappointments, I can only imagine the added heartache and pain these heartless people have caused the families. ” One progressive bitterly complained that the hotline’s mere existence was “racist” because it distinguished between citizens and  . “The VOICE tip line has nothing to do with helping victims. It provides no service, just refers you elsewhere,” he explained on Twitter, before wildly theorizing: “VOICE exists ONLY to collect anecdotes for Trump and his allies to demonize and   our [illegal] immigrant neighbors and families. ” He also told CNN he would keep pushing a harassment campaign until the hotline was “shut down. ” Espinoza strongly objected to accusations of racism. “Those who claim VOICE is a racist program, it’s evident they ignored the fact that this program was inspired by Latinos!” she told Breitbart News. “America First Latinos” sent a letter to all 50 governors in April 2015, calling for a program that would link state and local governments with   to assist families of illegal alien crime. “Violent illegal alien crime, especially crimes resulting in the deaths of American citizens, are like none other in our system of legal justice,” the letter stated. “In every case, the perpetrator who had gained access to our loved ones was illegally in the country aided by the failure of the government of the United States to protect our nation’s border, enforce current laws, and legislate for citizens. ” “We have been working very hard for two years for a program for the families of victims who were killed by illegal aliens due to the politician’s unwillingness to enforce current laws and afford Americans their rights under our Constitution,” Espinoza added. “[B]ecause of years and years of policies complicating immigration and enforcement efforts, and a   approach to public safety, there are mothers who will never again receive a Mother’s Day card from a son,” said Secretary Kelly, who has lost a son in Afghanistan, to victims of illegal alien crime Wednesday. “There are husbands who will never again kiss their wives. There are children who will never get to graduate from high school. These victims of illegal aliens aren’t data points. ” “They’re people,” he said."

[As Breitbart Texas reported, between Sunday night and Monday morning, a gunman walked into the Blue Parrot nightclub in the resort town of Playa Del Carmen, Quintana Roo, and began firing. Initial information pointed to four victims dying at the shooting and 12 others being wounded, however new information revealed that a woman was trampled by fleeing concertgoers.   A leaked document from Mexican authorities in Quintana Roo revealed that a woman described as being between 25 and 30 years of age appearing to be a tourist was the trampled victim. The woman did not have any formal identification with her and remains unidentified.  Two men who are believed to be Canadian nationals and part of the security detail for the concert are listed as having died from gunshot wounds. Italian and Colombian nationals are also listed among those who died from gunshot wounds. At least a dozen attendees were rushed to various local hospitals with gunshot wounds.  Mexican law enforcement officials not authorized to speak to the media confirmed to Breitbart Texas that they had detained four men for questioning but have not yet charged the gunman. Authorities report that terrorism was not the motive and are focusing their investigation into what appears to be an ongoing dispute between organized crime factions.  As Breitbart Texas has reported, Cancun and the surrounding towns had managed to avoid most of the cartel violence that tainted other tourist hotspots in Mexico.

[Marco Vinicio Perez, also known as Marco   allegedly murdered his girlfriend four years after he was ordered deported in 2012. Police arrested the illegal alien on   murder charges after he was accused of beating her to death last January because “demons in his head told him” to kill her.  Had he been deported to his native Guatemala on schedule, Idelcira Perez might still be alive. Almost nothing else is known about Perez, the Tallahassee Democrat explains, but he never appealed his deportation order. While more is known about Jamaican illegal Donald Robinson, it’s still not clear why he was not removed from the U. S. after being ordered deported in 2011:   …    [H]e was still in the U. S. when he was arrested in January 2015 at C. K. Steele Plaza for stabbing with a knife a man he thought was threatening him. Tallahassee Police investigators noted in their report of the incident that Robinson had eight other cases within the previous 18 months with TPD. He told them he had a mental illness, and in at least five reports, he told officers he was being followed, harassed and threatened with weapons, which he never saw. After spending more than a year in jail, Robinson was released on probation. But it wasn’t long before he was in trouble again. Last June, he was accused again of stabbing a man he did not know, this time with a pair of scissors, at the McDonald’s on North Monroe Street. It is not clear why Perez and Robinson were never deported, but there are extensive problems with federal databases tracking illegal aliens. Under the Obama administration, 1, 811 aliens from terrorist countries —  with final deportation orders —  were handed U. S. citizenship instead of being removed from the country. “Fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315, 000 immigrants with final removal orders or who are fugitive criminals,” the Associated Press reported in September. Until 2010, U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not log digital fingerprint records of illegal aliens consistently. There are some 148, 000 illegal aliens with final removal orders whose files do not contain fingerprint records, according to the Associated Press."

[During an interview with John Catsimatidis on AM 970 in New York, McCarthy blamed   brutality protests in Baltimore, Ferguson, and Charlotte for creating a “political atmosphere of   sentiment,” according to the Hill.  “So what’s happening, and this is ironic, is that a movement with the goal of saving black lives at this point is getting black lives taken, because 80 percent of our murder victims here in Chicago are male blacks,” McCarthy said. “Less than half of 1 percent of all the shootings in this city involve police officers shooting civilians. ” McCarthy was fired last year over the controversy caused by a fatal   shooting in October 2014 of a black    named Laquan McDonald. Dashcam video footage released a year later showed that Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke shot McDonald more than a dozen times, eventually killing him as he tried to walk away from the officers, NBC 5 Chicago reported. The officer was charged with   murder, and there was a public outcry that McCarthy resign. McCarthy admitted it was a “bad shooting” and that the officer in that incident should be punished, but also said that this   brutality sentiment is “hamstringing” law enforcement. McCarthy said that he is “hopeful” that   Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, will do more for police than the justice department under President Obama. “I think the Trump election quite frankly is a reaction to that,” he said. “I think the people are tired of career politicians who’ve never really had a job telling us how we should think and how we should act. ”"

[Speaking on Thursday, Chief Superintendent Dave Stringer, the head of “Community Engagement” for the Metropolitan Police, said:  Since Saturday evening’s attacks, we have increased the number of officers on the streets and in communities to reassure local people that they are able to go about their daily lives in peace and without fear of harassment or intimidation. Dedicated ward officers have also made contact with their local places of worship to encourage them to report hate crimes and to reassure those who congregate there that the police will take these crimes seriously. The Metropolitan Police has made 25 arrests for hate crime offences since Saturday. The news comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Piers Morgan in an interview that London’s police did not have enough resources to monitor the jihadists returning to the United Kingdom from Syria and Iraq. He said in an interview Wednesday morning: “I can’t follow 400 people  …     the Met Police budget, roughly   per cent comes from me, the Mayor. The rest is funded by central government. If the Met Police budget is being shrunk and reduced, they’ve got to prioritise and use their resources in a sensible, savvy way. ” Asked what could be a bigger priority than tracking jihadists in the UK’s capital city, Mr. Khan declined to answer.  Now, however, it seems we are learning of the Met’s priorities. The force boasted on Thursday of the large amount of resources they dedicate to policing hate crime. A statement from the police said: All hate crimes are reviewed by a Detective Inspector and the MPS has also increased specialist investigators within the 32 London borough community safety units by 30 per cent, with more than 900 specialist members of staff dedicated to investigating all hate crime and domestic abuse crimes. With the average salary of a police officer in London standing at around £38, 000, this means the force is dedicating around £35m of resources to hate crime policing.

Sadiq Khan said police were too stretched to follow returnee jihadists. But they can police words no problem. https:  .   —   Raheem  (@RaheemKassam) June 7, 2017,  The force also noted in its statement that it regards TellMAMA  —   a group which lost government funding after it was found they were artificially inflating hate crime numbers  —   as a reliable   for hate crime reporting. In 2014, TellMAMA lost its case with the Press Complaints Commission, when it objected to the original Telegraph reporting which revealed its dodgy figures. The Telegraph reported that many of their hate crime claims were exaggerations at best, and that out of the 212 “Islamophobic incidents” reported by Tell Mama, 57 per cent happened only online, with a further 16 per cent of incidents not being verified. Only eight per cent of incidents involved physical targeting, and no attacks were serious enough to require medical treatment. The group maintains a blog frequently criticising President Donald Trump,   campaigners such as the Center for Security Policy’s Frank Gaffney, and Breitbart. com. The Met Police statement adds: “We have increased the number of hate crime liaison officers who are a single point of contact for all those who need support after reporting a hate crime and we have introduced an Online Hate Crime Hub to tackle hate crime on social media. ” Raheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London.

14932,14933,33669,Only 14 Per Cent of ’Everyday Crimes’ Solved in Sweden,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,2017-03-14,2017.0,3.0,,"A damning new report has revealed Swedish police are facing difficulties solving even simple crimes and only 14 per cent of everyday crimes are solved. [New statistics reveal that in the first half of 2016 around 86 per cent of the crimes handled by Swedish police were ‘everyday crimes’ such as burglaries, simple theft, harassment, and vandalism.  The total cases numbered 655, 580. But shockingly, less than one in seven were ever solved and half of the crimes were never even investigated to begin with, Swedish broadcaster SVT reports.  According to the report, this is due to a lack of information regarding suspects and the crimes. The crimes that police find hardest to solve are theft and vandalism where only two per cent of cases were ever fully resolved. One of those affected by robbery was Norrköping resident Owe Karlsson whose house was robbed while he and his family were watching the Eurovision song contest. Karlsson said the thieves did not steal anything of great value but the fact they were so brazen and haven’t been caught made him anxious. Since the start of the year, six burglaries have occurred on his street, he said. The Swedish definition of a “solved” crime does not take into consideration a conviction for the crime, but rather if a suspect has been identified by authorities and the case prosecuted. The worst area for unsolved crimes is the Swedish capital of Stockholm, home to the notorious     suburbs of Husby and Rinkeby. Rinkeby has made headlines in recent weeks after a riot erupted in the following the arrest of a local resident. Shops were looted and a photographer from Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter was attacked and his camera stolen. Last week, footage emerged that showed how police are treated in   Zones by residents. The footage shows police being attacked in multiple incidents and residents telling them they have no authority in the suburbs. Violence and hostility to outsiders has grown to such a magnitude in Stockholm’s   Zones that police are struggling to find a contractor to build a new police station in Rinkeby because the construction contractors fear for the safety of their employees. “It would have to be guarded around the clock. This is because not only is there the risk of theft, but also the danger and threat to staff who will be working on the construction project,” anonymous police officers told Swedish media.

15261,15262,33998,NY Times: Convicted Alien Vote Fraudster’s Real Crime Was ‘Being Confused’,Breitbart,Logan Churchwell,2017-03-20,2017.0,3.0,,"The protracted public relations campaign on behalf of a  . S. citizen found to have voted illegally in north Texas continued over the weekend pages of The New York Times. [Legal and media allies of likely future deportee Rosa Maria Ortega, 37, of Grand Prairie continue to press the public on the inherent unfairness of a Texas law stating that voting when not eligible is a class 2 felony. As Breitbart Texas previously reported, Ortega was indicted in 2015 after attempting multiple times to register to vote in Tarrant County after casting ballots as a Dallas resident in the years prior. When told by Tarrant election officials that she could not qualify for registration as a green card holder, she then claimed to be a citizen in a subsequent attempt —  creating suspicion and a criminal investigation thereafter. Ortega was convicted of illegally voting in 2012 and 2014 and was sentenced to eight years in prison with deportation likely to follow.  The Times lent a friendly ear to Ortega over the weekend, noting that the junior high dropout continues to share her unhappiness with the proceedings: Her punishment may be unprecedented for an offense that often draws a minimal sentence or probation. Ms. Ortega, who has a   education and a sometimes shaky grasp on the complexities of her life, has steadfastly insisted that she did not know she was violating the law  —   that she is being imprisoned and probably deported for the crime of being confused. The article later summarizes Ortega’s attorney Domingo Garcia’s outrage by casting doubts on whether the Texas county that originally accepted the “affluenza” defense in a fatal   crash could fairly handle the voter fraud case. The puff piece then conflates different legal issues to paint Texas as discriminatory toward Hispanic voters: Ms. Ortega’s lawyers are casting her as a scapegoat. The case, they say, was manufactured to prop up Mr. Trump’s baseless   claims and an   law by the   Texas Legislature that tightens qualifications for voting. Federal courts have ruled that the latest version of that law discriminates against Latinos and other groups that tend to favor Democratic candidates. It is unclear if the author’s reference to an “  law   …     that tightens qualifications for voting” is the same law that Ortega was convicted of violating. Regardless, it has not had a discriminatory finding leveled against it by a federal court —  let alone challenged. The Times makes considerable effort to paint Ortega as a   resident who wants to make her voice heard, yet is sometimes confused by the complications of modern life in so doing. Even if that is true, the paper fails to note the multiple reminders of the law she faced when making her voter registration attempts. Regardless of whether she used a form printed by the State of Texas or the federal government, prospective voters are not asked if they believe they are eligible participate. Rather, they are asked binary questions under penalty of perjury that inform them further on whether to complete the application. Ortega answered “YES” multiple times to the question, “Are you a United States Citizen?” despite being a green card holder. The New York paper begrudgingly admits that Ortega’s hopes for leniency rest on shaky ground at best, noting that deportation back to Mexico will be a likely next step after her sentences are served. The Times does, however, see some slivers of victory in the form of public relations outreach: In the court of public opinion, they have had some success. Ms. Ortega’s conviction has drawn an outcry in editorials and from advocacy groups. Supporters contributed several thousand dollars to an online   aimed at supporting her family while she was imprisoned. Ortega’s story fits into a larger effort among   interest groups to take their fight against voter identification laws and the like to the court of public opinion, where if recent polling is suggestive of a larger trend, they are clearly underwater.   and former   super PACs have adopted missions to win “the public debate over voter suppression in the United States. ” It remains to be seen if previous postures claiming voter fraud is a nonexistent problem will shift to such crimes being excusable as criminal cases continue to mount. As an example, a columnist for the Fort Worth   wondered aloud if Ortega’s case proved that Texas’ laws were “too mean. ” Had Texas used a system that verified claims of citizenship during voter registration, the Mexican national could have been prevented from illegally voting altogether. Breitbart Texas reported at the time of Ortega’s sentencing on the legislation working though Austin: The Ortega case has been prosecuted amid legislative activity in states like Texas and Virginia, which are actively pursuing legal reforms that would require individuals seeking to become registered voters to prove U. S. citizenship as a prerequisite. In Austin, House Bill 1079, authored by Rep. Mike Schofield ( ) and SB 136, submitted by Sen. Van Taylor ( ) would require election clerks to verify citizenship with documents such as passports, birth certificates, and naturalization forms. The Public Interest Legal Foundation recently released a report documenting more than 1, 000 cases of voters being removed from Virginia’s rolls for reasons related to citizen eligibility. Similar legislation is under consideration in that state as well. Only one state, Kansas, currently requires prospective voters to prove citizenship. The Times closed with an ironic twist: “By registering and voting, [Ortega’s attorney] said, Ms. Ortega hoped to give her children a course in citizenship. ” Logan Churchwell is a founding editor of the Breitbart Texas team.

Dershowitz argued Mueller’s appointment would benefit Trump given that “collaborating with the Russians” to get elected wasn’t illegal and Mueller’s role would be to investigate illegalities. “[I] think he will be the beneficiary of the special prosecutor,” Dershowitz said. “A special prosecutor is supposed to investigate a crime and most of the things that have been leveled at the Trump administration are not criminal acts. Collaborating with the Russians to get yourself elected  —   not a criminal act. Terrible, morally wrong, but not criminal. The same thing is true with the leaking of the information to the Russians. ” Host Anderson Cooper and Dershowitz’s fellow panelists Jeffrey Toobin and Carl Bernstein argued the investigation should proceed, but Dershowitz insisted there wasn’t a criminal statute about what Trump and his campaign have been accused. “Let’s assume that that’s true  —   show me the criminal statute,” he said. “I still sit here as a civil libertarian. I don’t want us ever to become what Stalinist Russia became when Stalin was told by Lavrentiy Beria, ‘Show me the man and I’ll find you the crime.’ What is the crime?” Cooper said the question wasn’t whether or not it was illegal collusion or just collusion but if it occurred, to which Dershowitz said that wasn’t something over which Mueller would have jurisdiction. “[T]hat is a political issue, but that doesn’t give Mueller jurisdiction,” he added. “Mueller has no jurisdiction to explore whether he made political mistakes, did terrible things, engaged in wrongdoing. Only criminal acts. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

[According to the East Anglian Daily Times, locals were ‘extremely upset’ when they noticed the memorial’s Christ on the cross statue had been smashed off its plinth and “systematically” attacked to destroy its ears, face, and legs.  Anthony   who lives nearby, said he was “appalled” at the damage done to the monument, which commemorates residents of the small hamlet who lost their lives in World War I. “It’s wanton vandalism of a nasty nature on something which is the core of British society  —   our Christian religion  —   and attacking a war memorial too,” he said. Police are believed to be treating the incident as vehicular damage, but residents of the Essex hamlet insist the specific damage done to the statue, which lies fallen behind the plinth, points to its destruction having been a “deliberate” attack carried out by vandals. “It’s been quite systematically desecrated,” said Mr.  . “I think our neighbours are rather shocked, not quite as shocked as we are as it’s happened a couple of times before. “[The statue of Christ] has been smashed off the top and then laid on the ground and the face and the legs have been smashed off. It’s terrible. This was determined, wilful damage by one or more persons. ” Another local, who didn’t want to be named, said the damage looked like a “hate crime” telling the East Anglian Daily Times: “It looks like someone has smashed it up with a crowbar, or perhaps a knife. “It certainly looks deliberate, like someone has set out to do it really nastily. “The memorial is a real landmark because it has a figure of Christ on it, everyone in the village admires it,” she added. In November, Breitbart London reported that Dülmen’s Catholic community was left devastated by a wave of attacks on Christian statues in the German village. Local media detailed how ‘not a day goes by’ without locals discovering new damage to religious statues, in attacks that police admitted could have been motivated by   religious ideology. And in France, the nation’s interior minister revealed in February that attacks on Christian places of worship have more than doubled since 2008 while racist,   and   attacks saw a huge fall during the same period."

[“I want to make these crimes public.“ These seven words from a   “John Doe” have set off a chain reaction the likes of which would make even Edward Snowden or Julian Assange blush. When the source contacted German news outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung a year ago, they had no idea what was being offered.  The documents were encrypted communications from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, a purveyor of anonymous shell companies used by the world’s elite. Within the near 12 million leaked documents are damning indictments of world leaders, corrupt business dealings, and massive ethical conflicts of interest that span all the way from the 1970’s to 2016. Süddeutsche Zeitung made the decision to partner with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to try and parse all of the information available. According to the news organization itself, “around 400 journalists from more than 100 media organizations in over 80 countries have taken part in researching the documents. ” The analysis is far from over, but there are already more examples than there is space in a single story to cover them.

The Panama Papers have uncovered records of a shell corporation of which Lionel and his father Jorge are the “ultimate beneficiaries. ” Revelation of a purported method of Messi’s alleged tax evasion are going to be hard for the defense to counter, despite discrepancy with the dates involved. Until now, the star athlete has restricted himself to pleas of ignorance to the content of documents he signed and attempts to shift blame toward his own father. It’s a complicated case that is only getting more so. Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson is Iceland’s Prime Minister. He’s facing numerous calls for his resignation, including a 16, 000+ signature petition and the strong recommendation of another former PM. The Panama Papers revealed that he’d hidden millions of dollars worth of investments in offshore holding company Wintris Inc, and then diverted his shares to his wife for one dollar. Gunnlaugsson was elected on a platform of total transparency, so he’s taking more than a little heat after the revelation. Still, both he and his wife deny any wrongdoing, calling the entire case a “witch hunt. ” He didn’t respond too well to even the most straightforward inquiries about those activities, however. Juan Pedro Damiani is a long time member of FIFA’s   ethics committee and head of the J. P Damiani law firm. Alongside several other prominent figures in FIFA, the FBI believes Damiani’s firm to have been a part of the massive bribery schemes that have rocked the sport over the past several years. Three shell companies set up by the firm, all named “Cross Trading,” appear to have played a major part in bribing FIFA officials for marketing rights in the U. S. Petro Poroshenko, candy magnate and president of the Ukraine, is also facing calls for his removal. And while he insists that he has nothing to do with the management of his assets  —   a response that’s becoming common among those outed by the leak  —   Poroshenko’s critics aren’t buying it. While his administration campaigns against the use of offshore companies, even his allies insist that a parliamentary investigation of the matter is required. Even if he’s not impeached, his actions seem to loudly contradict his words, especially in light of Ukraine’s beleaguered economy.  —    These are just a few of the initial findings in the biggest digital security breach ever recorded. And with more information coming to light seemingly every hour, there are a multitude of strong reactions. John McAfee, cybersecurity guru and outlier president candidate, believes that the leak should serve as a warning to all of us about the vulnerability of our most closely held secrets. Reddit wants a piece of the action and is rallying users on the hunt for further revelations within the data. Those people calling for the Icelandic Prime Minister’s resignation are now standing on his front porch. But perhaps the true measure of the Panama Papers isn’t what may have been illegal activity. Maybe instead, we should look a little closer at how much of what’s happened is perfectly lawful, and how so many leaders of the world are willing to victimize their own for the sake of personal gain. Though both the US and UK have publicly refused to support Syrian atrocities in any way, Mossack Fonseca clients in both nations have been indirectly fueling Syria’s air force. This is far from over. The ICIJ is uncovering new information every day, and while the U. S. has been largely absent from the conversation so far, it’s not going to remain that way for long. Journalist Adam Johnson was among those who brought up our nation’s seeming immunity from the international scandal. But in response, the editor of Süddeutsche Zeitung’s response was ominous at best. Editor of Süddeutsche Zeitung responded to the lack of U. S. individuals in the documents, saying ”Just wait for what is coming next”  —   Mathew Ingram (@mathewi) April 3, 2016,  The Panama Papers are a loaded gun pointed squarely at some of the most protected people on the planet. We’ll continue to follow these revelations, and their echoes through the global halls of power. Some of the truths uncovered  —   perhaps even most of them  —   will be uncomfortable. As citizens of a nation that exists by and for the people, it’s our duty to evaluate that information, and to hold even our own leadership accountable for their representation of us all.

Every voice on the Left bleated about how they feared protests and riots by angry Donald Trump supporters if and when he lost the election, yet it is the leftists themselves destroying property and blocking roads. Everyone can see where the hate is coming from. Everyone. ” MILO continued. “It is sort of like how they are claiming the election was rigged right after they said that was impossible. Democrats, the difference between social media and real life is you cannot just delete what you said and pretend it never happened.  You’re hypocrites  —   and these riots and recount demands expose you. ” “The protesters themselves will have good jobs available if they choose to go straight. Otherwise they will be dealing with men like Sheriff David Clarke and Sheriff Joe Arpiao.  Good luck, guys. My money is on the sheriffs. To give you a flavour of how utterly miserable the Left is about all this, we are now in a   period in which leftists are faking hate crimes in an effort to paint Trump supporters negatively. ” said MILO. Referencing an event from a few weeks ago MILO said: “A Muslim woman at the University of Louisiana claimed Trump supporters attacked her. It didn’t happen. A gay man from Canada named Chris Ball says he was also attacked, and posted graphic pictures with a bloody face as proof. It also didn’t happen, according to the police. Do you have any idea how poor your hate crime hoax story has to be for the increasingly partisan Snopes. com to say it’s untrue?”  “These hoax crimes remind me of Rolling Stone. ” said MILO referencing Emma ‘Mattress Girl’ Sulkowicz,  “They set out to report on the rape culture of American campuses, but when they couldn’t find any examples, they just made shit up. As usual, I am ahead of the curve. I wrote a long time ago about the growing epidemic of fake hate crimes that has sprung up over the past 10 years  —   and opened the last leg of my Dangerous Faggot tour by asking why lesbians commit so many of them. ” MILO continued. “Hoaxers are only harming their own cause. While many are likely to avoid immediate punishment for making up stories in place of actual hate crimes by Trump supporters  —   which don’t exist  —   what the Trump presidency means for these imaginative fools is a wonderfully incriminating social media trail for potential employers. ” “Media cycles end, but the Internet never forgets. This is a valuable lesson especially for college students. Many of  the hoaxers come from campus, and they are ruining their future. The two liberals at Northwestern who defaced the interfaith chapel with spraypaint aren’t likely to find a job unless it is for George Soros, or maybe a pizza restaurant in Washington DC. ” Written from prepared remarks.

16255,16256,34993,Victims of Illegal Alien Crime on ’Sham’ Colorado Cruz Win: This Is ’Third World Tyranny’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Julia Hahn,2016-04-11,2016.0,4.0,,"The American victims who have lost their children to illegal alien crime denounced Sen. Ted Cruz’s “voterless victory” in Colorado. [The victims who endorsed Donald Trump said that they were appalled by the state GOP’s attempt to “silence” the American people. “The arrangement in Colorado is a sham. I can’t really call it an election. Ted Cruz is not for Americans,” said Cruz constituent Laura Wilkerson. “He is as bought and paid for as Hillary Clinton. ”  “This needs to be a wake up call for Americans,” said Texas resident Dan Golvach. “We have been sleep walking into a third world tyranny with the two main parties. This also shows you who Ted Cruz has crawled into bed with politically speaking  …     He’s nothing more than a poster boy for the plutocrats. I have no use for him or the plutocrat media complex that has been pushing these type of candidates on us. ” Dan Golvach and Laura Wilkerson are both Cruz constituents. While Cruz was in the U. S. Senate, an illegal alien randomly chose    Spencer Golvach’s “head as target practice” —   shooting and murdering Spencer. On his way home from school six years ago,    Joshua Wilkerson was tied up, beaten, strangled, set on fire, and tortured to death by his illegal alien classmate. Laura Wilkerson said, “After meeting him [Sen. Cruz] and testifying in front of him, in July last of year, [we heard] nothing. Not once has he reached out to a Texas American family that has lost a loved one from an illegal alien hands. I have seen the Ted Cruz that I met completely change his position on immigration. Right now he is as bought and paid for as Hillary Clinton. People should be outraged that the kids from Colorado who are fighting for America can’t even vote for the leader of America. It’s not right. ” Dan Golvach similarly said, “Ted Cruz as a Texas senator has never reached out to [our] family that had suffered the loss of a loved one at the hands of an illegal alien. We in the Remembrance Project have reached out to him numerous times, but he was too busy falling all over himself to get as many   foreign workers in here as he could to help keep wages down for his donor puppet masters. ” “It’s apparent the elections are no longer about what the American citizens want. Big money and the establishment are going to great lengths to silence us,” Mary Ann Mendoza said about Colorado’s voterless election. Mendoza’s son Sgt. Brandon Mendoza was murdered by a drunk illegal alien who had been driving the wrong way down a freeway. The illegal alien’s blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit at the time of the crash. “Cruz should call for an election in Colorado  …     We are becoming like a third world country with all of this government corruption,” said Billy Inman. “There ought to be an election and everyone ought to be able vote in it. Trump has the backing of the American working people. If these GOP politicians worked as hard on improving America for Americans as they are working to get rid of Donald Trump, America would still be a great nation. ” Inman’s    son Dustin was murdered while he and his family were on their way to celebrate an early Father’s Day family fishing trip. An illegal alien rear ended their family’s vehicle at over 60 mph. Dustin’s parents, Billy and Cathy, were both knocked unconscious. They were unable to attend their son’s funeral because they were in   comas for weeks after their son’s death. “They don’t listen to us. They just do not listen to us. It’s too much corruption. I truly believe that. There’s too much money involved and too much corruption. They are trying to silence us, ” Inman said of Cruz’s voterless win. “Trump is the only one who can give us a voice. I’ve been talking about this problem [i. e. immigration] for 16 years and he’s the only one whose done anything about it. ” Cathy Inman, who is now permanently confined to a wheelchair due to spinal injuries she sustained from the crash that killed her only child, told Breitbart: “I feel like nobody cares. It’s hard. I’m in pain   and the officials do not care. ” At the Colorado state convention on Saturday, the Trump campaign read aloud letters written by the victims to a stadium full of mostly Cruz delegates before they selected their national slate."

16790,16791,35528,There Have Been Over 100 Hate Crime Hoaxes In The Past Decade - Breitbart,Breitbart,Milo,2016-05-02,2016.0,5.0,,"Victimhood is profitable. On the internet, it can get you thousands of dollars in crowdfunding donations. In the media, it can win you national prominence and a cooing audience of credulous sycophants. On campus, it can get you attention and plaudits from fellow  . [Convince enough people you’re a victim, and everyone from presidential candidates to celebrities will come rushing to support you.  So it’s little wonder that charlatans and opportunists regularly seek to take advantage of our species’ natural instinct for empathy. False flags, in which people deliberately stage attacks on themselves to win the support of society, are as old as history itself. That isn’t an exaggeration, by the way. They’re really as old as history itself. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus once recalled how Peisistratos, a man who would become the dictator of Athens, staged a fake attack on himself to gain the support of the city: Wounding himself and his mules, he drove his wagon into the marketplace, with a story that he had escaped from his enemies, who would have killed him (so he said) as he was driving into the country. So he implored the people to give him a guard. Taken in, the Athenian people gave him a guard of chosen citizens   …     These rose with Peisistratos and took the Acropolis and Peisistratos ruled the Athenians.  Faking assassination attempts are risky these days, and the benefits are questionable. A failed murder attempt might make the local news, but unless you’re already a celebrity or a politician, there isn’t much to be gained. Claim to be a victim of a hate crime, though, and half of today’s     society will run to your doorstep to offer its support. That’s assuming you get away with it, of course. The typical victim hoax is so clumsily implemented that it is only believable to those that are well trained to embrace their victimhood status and, as is also necessary, suspend their critical faculties. That’s why they don’t work so well on conservatives, who are more sceptical of such claims. Think of Rafael Edward “Ted” Cruz blaming Roger Stone and the Trump campaign for the “sex scandal” story, when it was widely known that Little Marco’s people were the ones shopping the story. Victimhood isn’t just used to push agendas and win power. It can also be used to make money. Professional victims like feminist pest Anita Sarkeesian have received thousands of dollars in donations after complaints about unkind words on the internet. Little wonder that there’s been such an epidemic of hate crime hoaxes in the past few years, particularly among regressive activists on university campuses. We’ve seen students scrawl swastikas on the doors of their own dorm rooms, send themselves anonymous rape threats, and falsely accuse fraternities of  . So severe is the problem, lawyer and author Mike Cernovich has taken it upon himself to compile a guide on how to recognise common patterns in these hoaxes. This got Breitbart thinking. How many hate crime hoaxes have occurred in, say, the past decade? Progressives seem to get busted every other month, but surely that’s just our own biased impression. When we started our search, we were expecting to find twenty, perhaps forty examples from the past decade of   hate crimes that turned out to be frauds. If only. We found over a hundred, spread across race, gender, sexuality and religion. Perhaps thanks to the effect of social media and   sleuthing, reports of   hoaxes undergo a massive surge in the years after 2011. 2015 seems to have been a high point  —   our search found over 20 incidents in that year alone. Then again, we’re only a quarter of the way through 2016. There have already been four major hate crime hoaxes this year. And consider this: those are just the ones that were reported. How many other hate crime hoaxers are still out there, undiscovered and unpunished? It’s impossible to say, but given human empathy’s tendency to override scepticism, we suspect the number is high  —   and probably rising. Because the left is running out of real haters. As  British journalist Douglas Murray likes to say, the Left has a    problem with bigotry. There simply isn’t enough of it to go around, so reporters have to go “rape shopping” like Sabrina Erdely did for Rolling Stone, or they have to enlarge the definitions of “racism” and “homophobia” to include minuscule perceived infractions, called “microaggressions. ” If you live in an Anglosphere nation, you are living in one of the most tolerant, peaceful societies in recorded history. Attitudes towards women’s rights, gay rights, and the rights of other races have never been more progressive. Among Millennials, attitudes to abortion, gay marriage, and other social issues are vastly more liberal than their parents. If history is any guide, the next generation is likely to be even more socially liberal. With the Left reduced to chasing imaginary microaggressions and   owners who’d rather not cater lesbian weddings, it’s little wonder that they have to turn to hoaxes to convince the public that bigotry is still alive and well. It will do them no good. Despite the scaremongering, bigotry in western nations is in terminal decline. Soon, only the hoaxes will remain. We can’t be far off from social justice education at top universities including courses on effective victim hoaxing. This may seem incredibly brazen to those of us with a modicum of integrity, but it isn’t a big step from where we are today. After all, we already have courses that do little more than teach students that straight white males are the devil and which peddle outright conspiracy theories such as the “patriarchy” and “systematic oppression. ” On the bright side, candidates for the PhD in SJW Hoax Studies may be hired by the CIA for false flag operations abroad, marking the first time a graduate of a   course has been hired anywhere outside of academia, diversity offices and McDonalds. Interestingly, false flag hoaxes in the West almost exclusively use white males at the hoax’s target. Why not use Militant Islam which is a much more believable aggressor? I guess one explanation is that it’s hard to fake chopping your head off, or having you and your loved ones blown to bits, when you can, as a Tennessee lesbian couple famously did, burn your own house down after scrawling QUEERS on the front wall to collect the insurance money. The media, and society as a whole, needs to become less gullible. Activists ought to give the police at least a week to determine the culprit before leaping to Twitter to coin the next hip protest hashtag. Journalists should let the police investigate before writing long, sympathetic stories about what the “hate crimes” say about our allegedly bigoted society. Because, in reality, there’s only one thing that these hoaxes say about our society: that we’re all mugs. Especially white people, who typically serve as the villains in these hoaxes and beat themselves up every time one of these nasty progressive liars dreams up a poop swastika. 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, Follow Milo Yiannopoulos (@Nero) on Twitter and Facebook.

[In recent weeks, multiple establishment media reports have documented the defining role Sessions has played in the 2016 election.  Talking Points Memo recently declared: “This is the Jeff Sessions election and the GOP is just along for the ride. ” Vanity Fair similarly observed that the “intellectual groundwork for Trump’s campaign and the Republican civil war that he has unleashed was laid without much notice in an unlikely place. In the summer of 2013, Alabama senator Jeff Sessions noted that passing immigration reform, at last as Washington understood the term, would be an unmitigated disaster. ” Roll Call notes that the memo “Sessions sent to other GOP senators in 2013  …     foreshadowed the genesis of Trump’s candidacy by urging the party to embrace an ‘honest populism’ designed ‘to speak directly to the real and legitimate concerns of millions of hurting Americans whose wages have declined and whose job prospects have grown only bleaker. ’” The Hudson Institute’s John Fonte remarked upon the “conservative populist breakout” early last year writing, “the political leader of the conservative populist coalition is the indefatigable Senator Sessions. Day in and day out, for the past two years, Sessions has been issuing memos and talking points, giving speeches, and making media appearances explicating a coherent populist message. The Alabamian is a conviction politician. ” Sessions recently explained that “this election will be the last chance for Americans to get control of their government. ” In an interview with Howie Carr, Sessions explained that “this may be the last opportunity the American people have to have their will imposed and create a lawful immigration system that serves the national interest. ” Sessions noted how it is critical for the preservation of American sovereignty and the interests of American workers that President Obama’s   Partnership “must not pass. ” Sessions explained that on “these two issues [i. e. immigration and TPP]  …     the voters should say, ‘If you’re not going to be right on those, I’m not voting for you in this primary and I’m not going to vote for you as president.’ I really think it’s that important. ” Conservative legend and grassroots heroine Phyllis Schlafly expounded upon the assertions of Sen. Sessions stating, “Our immigration policy has been   decade after decade, and the voters need to know that 2016 might be our last chance to elect a president who can reduce this tide of illegals crossing our borders. ” “Our nation’s sovereignty depends on control of both immigration and trade, and that’s why Senator Sessions urges voters to choose a candidate who promises to kill the   Partnership trade deal with nearly a dozen Asian nations,” Schlafly proclaimed. Schlafly, who like Sessions represents the gold standard for grassroots conservatives, has similarly become a leading voice in the 2016 election. Schlafly has thrown much of her political weight behind the candidacy of Donald Trump, who shares her desire for curbing immigration and promoting   trade policies. Schlafly has explained that Trump is “the only hope to defeat the kingmakers” —   i. e. the Republican Party’s donor class. The Sessions Test consists of five questions: Question 1: How would you vote (or how did you vote) on   and would you support or oppose advancing a final trade agreement which enters the United States into a new international commission with binding authority on future United States trade policy? Question 2: If the vote on the   Partnership were held today, and you had a vote to cast in Congress, would you vote for it or against it? Question 3: Upon entering office, will you promptly and unconditionally terminate and rescind all of President Obama’s illegal executive amnesties  —   which provide work permits and entitlements to illegal aliens  —   including President Obama’s first executive amnesty in 2012, which remains in effect? Question 4: A supermajority of GOP voters say immigration is too high. Every year, on autopilot, we let in another 1 million immigrants on green cards, 700, 000 foreign guest workers, half a million foreign students, and 100, 000 refugees and asylees. Historical precedent would be to reduce   immigration, rather than continuing to surge it beyond all historical precedent. Will you support legislation to reduce immigration numbers, and will you oppose legislation that would add to the number? Question 5: Today, law enforcement are under increasing scrutiny and face excessive criticism from the political elites and the media, and are being targeted by criminals and terrorists. Meanwhile, since 2011, the federal prison population has declined by over 20, 000, and is on track to be at its lowest level since 2005. Since 2009, the total state prison population has dropped every year, and is over 56, 000 lower than it was then. These circumstances may have contributed to a nationwide spike in crime. The FBI recently reported an overall increase in violent crime and a 17 percent increase in homicides in the nation’s 50 largest cities. At the same time, the CDC reports that heroin and opioid drug overdoses have reached an   record high. Do you support efforts by President Obama and some Republicans in Congress to reduce penalties for   and further reduce the federal prison population, or do you think government should do more to keep drug traffickers off the streets?

17815,17817,36557,EXCLUSIVE - Kathleen Willey Blasts Feminists for Ignoring Bill Clinton’s Alleged Crimes Against Women While Hillary ‘Enabled’,Breitbart,Breitbart News,2016-04-10,2016.0,4.0,,"Kathleen Willey, one of the women who famously accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, and who has said she faced attempts to intimidate and silence her, used a radio interview on Sunday to blast established feminists for not speaking out about Bill Clinton’s alleged sex crimes. [Willey said she found it “very frustrating” that feminists haven’t called out Hillary Clinton for ignoring the controversies over her husband’s alleged assaults against women.  Stated Willey: I don’t understand why these [feminist] women will not address this. It’s a problem. It’s Hillary Clinton’s problem. It’s Bill Clinton’s problem. It’s Chelsea Clinton’s problem.  Hillary Clinton chose to look the other way, to allow herself to be humiliated in front of the world and she enabled him to continue on with his behavior.  And it has not stopped. You know, if he has a consensual relationship with somebody and she doesn’t care and he doesn’t care, then I guess that’s none of our business. But when it crosses the line into rape and sexual harassment and sexual assault, well then that ought to be the business of the feminists. Willey was speaking on “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” the popular Sunday talk radio program broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer, and on NewsTalk 990 AM. Klein doubles as Breitbart’s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter. Willey told Klein that when she first went public in 1998 about Clinton’s alleged sexual assault, one of the first things she did was attempt to secure support from feminist groups and activists, only to have her overtures met with silence. When this all started happening to me, the first thing I did when I didn’t know what do, the first thing that I did was reach out to the feminists. To the Women of the World, to Patricia Ireland, to all of these women. And I got no answer. I got completely cut off.  They would not respond. And I remember thinking to myself: What is this? I mean, what is this? As much as I was in Democratic circles and working in the White House, it actually took me a while to realize that these women are not going to criticize Bill Clinton. And it’s all about abortion. It’s all about abortion. That’s all it was. And when you have   …     Nina Burleigh saying publicly that they would gladly service Bill Clinton if he kept abortion on the table, then what are the victims and what are the women who suffered like this [supposed to do]? Willey asked: “Why aren’t these women addressing this?  I mean, we’re still dealing with it. We are still dealing with rape on college campuses, rape in the military.  I mean, it’s still a big problem. Why won’t they address this?” She added: And there are more things out there that women are concerned about than abortion. When are they going to get their priorities straight? When are they going to address the things that are really addressing women today. Besides equal pay. Besides abortion. Besides the glass ceiling."

17938,17940,36680,"Obama Commutes More Drug Traffickers’ Sentences Amid Heroin Epidemic, Crime Spike - Breitbart",Breitbart,Katie McHugh,2016-11-23,2016.0,11.0,,"Outgoing President Obama has shortened the prison sentences of another 79 drug traffickers, many of whom were also convicted on weapons charges or had prior drug convictions. [The new sentencing commutations mean that Obama has shortened jail sentences for more than 1, 000 criminals, many of whom are quickly released from prison.  Drug overdoses take tens of thousands of American lives: More than 47, 000 people died   deaths in 2014, including 10, 574 from heroin. The FBI in its annual report on crime statistics found the murder rate rose a shocking 11. 8 percent in 2015, with violent crimes increasing 3. 9 percent from the previous year. Because of Obama’s   commutations, a former armed cocaine dealer will be back on Virginia’s streets in March. So will a convicted armed Philadelphia crack cocaine dealer, and a jailed armed California meth dealer. Another former armed Texas drug trafficker sentenced to life in prison had his sentence commuted to 38. 75 years. An armed Florida cocaine dealer had his life sentence reduced to 25 years. All told, 21 prisoners with   charges, many of whom were also drug traffickers, just received reduced sentences from Obama. One convicted heroin dealer, arrested for trying to sell more than 2. 2 pounds of heroin, had his already reduced,   sentence cut to a mere four months, and also was excused from paying a $10, 000 fine. A woman convicted for conspiring to traffic over 1, 000 kilograms (2, 204 pounds) of marijuana, plus 11 pounds of powder cocaine, also had her unpaid $10, 000 fine remitted. Another crack cocaine dealer also got a free pass on an unpaid $7, 500 fine. Heroin is synthesized from morphine, and once it reaches the brain, it turns back into morphine, “which binds to molecules on cells known as opioid receptors. ” Some are located in the brain stem, which regulates breathing. An overdose may suppress breathing, causing permanent brain damage or death. Heroin can be three times more potent than morphine. Traffickers will sometimes boost heroin with fentanyl, sourced primarily from Mexico or China. Fentanyl can be 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin —  dousing the brain all at once. One quarter of a milligram can kill a person. To make matters worse, some dealers are mixing an elephant tranquilizer, carfentanil, into heroin batches. Carfentanil is 10, 000 times stronger than morphine, and 100 times more powerful than fentanyl. As The Atlantic explains,”opioids are chemicals that change the way the brain perceives pain. Some   patients, experiencing relief for the first time in years, describe them as ‘a miracle.’ A pulled tooth might be agonizing, but with a little Vicodin, the brain thinks the mouth is in   shape. ” Addicts “organize their whole lives around getting more opioids,” and unlike other chronic diseases or conditions, there is no one way to provide a cure, one expert said. Much of the heroin epidemic is fueled by illegal immigration, with illegal alien drug mules bringing deadly drugs across the border as Obama further cuts border surveillance. The federal government has also reduced surveillance of the purchases and resales of legal painkillers. Manufacturers who sold narcotic painkillers glossed over the addiction risks of their pills, while the medical establishment came to believe that chronic pain should not be endured. But painkillers are expensive, and some people slip into addiction via a cheaper alternative with similar effect: heroin. Heroin addiction is gradual, as one user writes, and sneaks up on users: “I have literally never met anyone who was introduced to heroin with a needle. That’s roughly the equivalent of taking your first drink of alcohol by   moonshine out of a gas can. The reality is a lot less abrupt, and a lot scarier: Most people start by popping and smoking pills. In that stage, it never seems like a problem, because you can use daily for weeks with no withdrawal effects whatsoever. ” “Once you’re at the stage where you’re even considering the needle, you long ago forgot about ‘squeamishness’ right along with ‘work’ and ‘everything else you ever wanted to accomplish in your life,’” he added. Building up a tolerance means users seek more of the drug to reach the same high, leading to overdoses. Using needles to inject heroin spreads Hepatitis C and HIV, racking up massive healthcare costs and devastating lives. The White House boasts that Obama is remedying “the unfairness at the heart of the system”: The President has now commuted the sentences of 1, 023 men and women incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws, including 342 individuals who were serving life sentences. The majority were offenders sentenced for nonviolent drug crimes. To date, the President has granted commutations to more prisoners than the past 11 presidents combined. He has also granted 70 pardons and is committed to continuing to exercise the clemency power with additional grants of commutations and pardons throughout the remainder of his presidency. None of the 79 prisoners with   sentences were charged for simple possession. They participated in drug trafficking, an inherently violent enterprise. Obama justified the commutations as “the right thing to do. ” At the heart of America is the idea that we’re all imperfect. We all make mistakes. We have to take responsibility and learn from those mistakes. And we as a society have to make sure that people who do take responsibility for their mistakes are able to earn a second chance to contribute to our communities and our country. It’s the right thing to do. It’s the smart thing to do. Now it’s up to good minds on both sides of the aisle to come together to restore fairness in our criminal justice system, use our tax dollars more effectively, and give second chances to those who have earned them. The Obama administration has also released 30, 000 convicts in federal prison, following revisions in sentencing guidelines, and may release another 40, 000 criminals, according to Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton."
18020,18022,36762,Soros-Linked Think Tank Says Border Control Causing Hate Crimes,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,2016-12-05,2016.0,12.0,,"The Institute of Race Relations (IRR) has released a report in which it claims that policies to control immigration have caused a “rapid rise in racial violence”. [The   think tank, whose director Liz Fekete attacked “ ” group Hope Not Hate for discussing Pakistani grooming gangs, argues border control and efforts to crack down on illegal immigration are responsible for a wave of “hate crimes” across Britain.  Advancing the narrative that Britain’s vote to leave the European Union (EU) unleashed an “explosion of racist violence” the paper’s foreword states that “whatever else Brexit means or does not mean, it certainly means racism”. Author Jon Burnett argues that the media narrative surrounding   “hate crimes”  —   that the number of reported incidents rose after the referendum, with Britain’s vote to leave the EU emboldening “hate”  —   absolves the state of blame. “It was not a just a ‘spike’ a ‘jump’ or a ‘spate’ as the mainstream consensus has it. It is the literal manifestation of the political climate which sustains it,” he writes. The document notes that the government has been active in opposing “hate crimes” and developing programmes to crack down on “hate” but argues that by enforcing border control and cracking down on illegal immigration, the government is itself responsible for “hate crimes”. The foreword states: “The struggle then is on two levels, both at once: against state racism and against ‘hate crime’. ” To advance this theory Burnett states that, based on the IRR’s consideration of just 134 incidents of “hate” seen in Britain, “much of the racist abuse that has followed the referendum result has had its gestation within policy measures which express the same aim”. To back this up, he says “the racist assault of a homeless migrant, who is not deemed to be economically productive” has its origins in policies that try to prevent mass migration of groups which are major drains on British taxpayers. Fgure 2 of the document shows policies and comments made by politicians that the author believes legitimised “hate crimes”. These include requirements to check legal immigration status of workers, the Prevent counterterrorism strategy, and a statement made by former Prime Minister David Cameron in 2011 which condemned “Islamist extremism”. In the paper’s foreword,    Sri Lankan migrant and lifelong campaigner against “racism” in Britain, Ambalavaner Sivanandan, argues that laws to control immigration are “state racism” and that the government has “ma[de] nativism the state ideology”. “In siphoning off racism and racial violence, which are   to the terrain of law and order, the government conceals its complicity in creating state racism,” he writes. In the paper, which is titled “Racial Violence and the Brexit State” it is implied that any kind of border controls at all encourage racist attacks, asserting that: “A nation state, which is   …     defined specifically to divide those who rightfully belong from those who do not, will by definition enshrine racism. ” In 2012 the institute’s director, Liz Fekete, penned a letter which attacked “ ” body Hope Not Hate, for admitting that Pakistani grooming gangs are a problem. Fekete slammed the group’s “uncritical” take on the Ministry of Justice’s statistics, which she says “are not scientific and neutral” and blasts their assertion that the left in Britain and “ ” are “too quick to try and silence any discussion” on the systematic rape, torture, and abuse of white children that it emerged has been happening in towns across Britain. The organisation also produces “educational materials” for teachers designed to stir up resentment against white people. Among the implications and claims made in these teaching resources are that Europe is only safe, rich, and peaceful today because of slavery and colonialism, which the materials instruct is the cause of racism today. Racism, and by implication white people, are responsible for all problems faced by ethnic minorities in Britain including with “employment, housing, education, policing and law enforcement” according to the IRR’s teaching resources. An essay published by the IRR in 2012 condemns the media for reporting on racist violence against white people by ethnic minorities. One example given is a Daily Mail story headlined  “Girl gang who kicked woman in the head while yelling ‘kill the white slag’ freed after judge hears ‘they weren’t used to drinking because they’re Muslims’”. By reporting on such incidents author Ryan   says the media is constructing a “false equivalence” between white on black and black on white violence, and encourages “far right” demonstrations."
18054,18056,36796,Teacher-Killer Migrant Gives Police Motive For Crime,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,2016-04-01,2016.0,4.0,,"The Afghan migrant who brutally murdered a teacher in Germany explains to police the motive behind the crime. [A    migrant from Afghanistan killed    teacher Medhi H. in cold blood after what was assumed to be a heated argument back in February. The case left investigators puzzled and it took over a month to make an arrest in the case.  Now the reason for the argument, and the motive for murder, has apparently been revealed. The migrant told police that the      teacher had fallen in love with his    daughter and that he had intentions to marry her. Lars Janssen, spokesman for the prosecution in Celle told Die Welt Thursday, “the accused stated that the victim had wanted to take his eldest daughter as his wife. ” According to the prosecution, the teacher was well known to the perpetrator’s family and he had a close relationship with them. German media had speculated on the motive for the crime with at least one publication saying that the teacher had feelings for the migrant’s daughter but this was the first confirmation since the   ’s arrest. The victim of the crime was of Iranian origin and had met the Afghani family in a nearby migrant camp where he had volunteered his time to help people he thought were in desperate need. Coming from a migrant background he likely felt a kinship with those fleeing from their countries. He also worked as an interpreter  and befriended many migrants at the camp. He even let many migrants stay at his house while they were looking for accommodation outside the migrant camp. The same welcoming attitude led to the murder of an American au pair in Vienna last year when she attempted to help a Gambian migrant avoid deportation and in return he strangled her to death. The accused migrant has so far been charged with manslaughter by the Celle courts. The court accuses him of killing the teacher with a large rock and a blunt metal object due to the dispute over the migrant’s daughter. According to local press the migrant had come to the region in December along with his wife and six children. The prosecution maintains that so far there is no evidence beyond the word of the accused, that the    teacher had any interest in his daughter sexual or otherwise. The teacher worked at a nearby high school in Celle and was said to be very popular among the students. The school held a large memorial service on school grounds that was well attended. The teacher’s body was flown to Iran where he was buried in Tehran in early March. It was his wish to be buried in the presence of his family and friends."

After failing to deport him, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released Olango in 2003. and he was then “placed under supervision due to a Supreme Court ruling that forbids the detention of foreign nationals with final deportation orders for more than six months if they cannot be deported ‘within the reasonably foreseeable future. ’” In 2009, after Olango served time in prison for a firearms conviction, ICE again tried to have him deported. But ICE said, according to the Times, “Once again the attempts were unsuccessful, leading to Mr. Olango’s release from ICE custody on an order of supervision. ” ICE observed, “This is often due to a foreign government’s refusal to accept the repatriation of its nationals. ” Olango’s brother reportedly complains that Olango is being perceived as a dangerous criminal  —   a perception reinforced by a still image of him pointing the object at police on Tuesday.

19237,19239,37982,Italian High Court Rules Public Masturbation Not a Crime,Breitbart,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",2016-09-09,2016.0,9.0,,"Italy’s highest court has ruled that public masturbation is no longer a crime in Italy, exonerating a    man who had been convicted of “autoeroticism” performed in front of a group of female students at the University of Catania last May. [The man, identified only as “Pietro L,” was arrested for “having extracted his member” and masturbated in public, and later sentenced to three months in prison. The Catania court had found the man guilty despite his claims that his action was a first offense and that few saw him because of “the reduced visibility at dusk. ”  On appeal, Italy’s Supreme Court, or Corte di Cassazione, ruled that public masturbation had actually been decriminalized under 2015’s Legislative Decree 8, though it was still punishable by a fine. The justices of the Supreme Court have thus eliminated the effects of a criminal conviction for obscene acts in public places (except where minors are involved) and the charges against the man were lowered to a misdemeanor. Pietro’s jail sentence was thereby commuted into a fine, and the action will be expunged from his criminal record. It is now up to local courts in Catania to determine the exact amount of the administrative fine, stipulated between €5, 000 ($5, 640) and €30, 000 ($33, 825). By virtue of this measure, the court has cancelled the man’s guilty verdict “because the act does not fall under criminal law. ” While the Renzi government has never paid much attention to equal opportunities, said Elvira Savino, a parliamentarian from the   Forza Italia party, “to keep people who commit obscene acts in front of women out of jail is really inexcusable. ” “The government’s law is an invitation to every maniac to keep molesting women,” she posted on Facebook.

S. throughout 2016, worsening the crime wave that began in 2014, according to new data. [Homicides jumped in 16 of 20 major U. S. cities, while 37 out of 65 of the country’s biggest police departments saw “   homicide increases” as of the end of September, according to The Wall Street Journal:  Nationally, 37 of the 65 largest police agencies, including ones in San Antonio, Las Vegas and Memphis, Tenn. reported    homicide increases as of Sept. 30, the Major Cities Chiefs Association said. In 2015, 44 departments reported increases, many for the first time in years. “I have a lot of concern about that many cities experiencing those increases in violence,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the association, which represents chiefs from the largest departments. He said it is too early to know whether the increases constitute a trend. Mr. Stephens said he thinks crime is largely driven by local dynamics such as   violence. But he said police chiefs nationwide bemoan the easy availability of firearms. In Chicago, police have seized more than 8, 000 illegal guns this year. He also said solutions to stem the tide of violence will require more than policing strategies. Chicago’s gun crime death toll is so high it’s distorting national murder figures the number of murders in Chicago hit 755 on December 21 for the year so far, Chicago Tribune reports. An opioid epidemic is ravaging communities across the country as well, which may contribute to increases in crime.  These dramatic increases in 2015 add to the sharp increases in 2015 reported by the FBI’s 2015 crime report. Murders rose 10. 8 percent nationwide in 2015, the sharpest increase since 1971. During that same year,   crime dropped by 2. 6 percent and burglaries fell by 7. 8 percent, but aggravated assault rose 4. 6 percent, rape rose 6. 3 percent, and vehicle thefts rose 3. 1 percent. Property crimes, not including arson, cost victims $14. 3 billion. The Major Cities Chiefs Association also said, “rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults and   shootings” had increased as of the end of September as well. The FBI hinted that the nationwide crime rate rose as Obama’s “  ” campaign against local and state law enforcement began.  Americans are deeply concerned about the increases in crime: 53 percent told Gallup in April they “worry a great deal” about crime. Plus, 44 percent were also concerned about drug use. Almost   of U. S. households (29 percent) say they or a family member has been victimized by violent crime within the last year, another Gallup survey found."

20031,20033,38778,"Obama: Crime Created by ’System,’ Successful People ’Just Lucky,’ ’Wasn’t Nothin’ You Did’ - Breitbart",Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2016-05-10,2016.0,5.0,,"In his commencement speech to the graduating class at Howard University last weekend, President Obama excused crime in the African American community as something fostered by an “unfair and unjust” system. [He also said successful people were “just lucky” and hinted they didn’t make their success “It wasn’t nothin’ you did,” he insisted.  Obama appeared at the historically African American Howard University on May 7 to send the graduates off into the world with some inspiring words. But much of what the president said was less inspirational and more conspiratorial. The president spent a large portion of the first 15 minutes of his speech properly impressing upon the minority students in attendance that they are living in an era of unprecedented opportunity. But even as he noted how far African Americans have come in America today, he said he would be speaking to the inequities blacks face. Still, in the first half of his speech Obama did mention how far African Americans have come since he was a child. For instance, Obama praised pop queen Beyoncé and TV showrunner Shonda Rhimes as examples of how far African Americans have progressed since the Civil Rights movement began in the U. S. He also noted that blacks have come a long way in business and the law. But finally, about twenty minutes into his speech, he did, indeed, get to the usual victim mentality all too often seen on the political scene today. At one point Obama excused crime as a result of an “unfair and unjust” system and noted that success is all just “luck. ” The president decried the judicial system and insisted blacks are being imprisoned unfairly. “We can’t just lock up a   dealer without asking why this boy, barely out of childhood, felt he had no other options,” Obama said. He went on to claim crime was a result of the system, not the actions of criminals. “We have cousins and uncles and brothers and sisters who we remember were just as smart and just as talented as we were, but somehow got ground down by structures that are unfair and unjust,” he said. That brought the President to his thoughts on success being more a result of luck than hard work. “And that means we have to not only question the world as it is,” Obama intoned, “and stand up for those African Americans who haven’t been so lucky —  because, yes, you’ve worked hard, but you’ve also been lucky. ” As an aside, the President of the United States then told his audience of his “pet peeve. ” “That’s a pet peeve of mine  —   people who have been successful and don’t realize they’ve been lucky. That God may have blessed them it wuddn’t nothin’ you did. So don’t have an attitude. ” This line invokes his “you didn’t build that” gaffe from 2012 when Obama insisted that people with a successful business “didn’t build that” on their own and that government was really the catalyst for success. The President’s commencement message is essentially that if you are black in the U. S. and you are successful, it was just luck and most blacks are held down by an “unfair and unjust” system that won’t allow them to succeed. Obama also raised eyebrows when he insisted that he never intended to create a “  society” with his presidency. “My election did not create a   society,” Obama told the graduating class “I don’t know who was propagating that notion. That was not mine. ” It was a speech that talkshow host Rush Limbaugh called “hideous. ” The President’s speech comes on the heels of years of releasing into the public tens of thousands of illegal immigrants who have been apprehended and convicted of committing violent criminal offenses including rape, drug dealing, drunk driving, and even murder. Further, with his “national reentry” policy, Obama has also worked to soften or eliminate the consequences of committing serious crimes and ensure   are given the same advantages as lifelong,   citizens. Obama’s own efforts are only emboldened by the efforts of the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives in pushing a sentencing reform bill that some senators charge will release violent felons and drug traffickers back into the public.

20388,20391,39137,Remembering Grant Ronnebeck: A Victim of A Mexican Cartel and Illegal Alien Crime - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katie McHugh,2016-06-10,2016.0,6.0,,"The family of Grant Ronnebeck is showing a video commemorating their son, murdered in January by an illegal alien free on bond. [The video also pleads for the enforcement of immigration laws and unveils a new foundation meant to help Americans harmed by illegal alien crime.  “Grant was just my buddy, from the minute he was born. He just brightened everybody: My family, my friends. He was everything,” Grant’s father, Steve Ronnebeck, says. Ronnebeck explained he lived paycheck to paycheck in the stagnant economy, and after he and his wife divorced, Grant got a job at the Quick Trip mart in Mesa, Arizona, to help pay the bills. “He did this without question or hesitation. It was just the kid he was,” Ronnebeck says.  (Courtesy of Steve Ronnebeck) But everything changed on January 22, 2015. “My   had called me and said, ‘Have you heard from Grant?’ I was like, no, he’s at work. She said: Well, something happened at QT and you might want to get ahold of him,” he says. “I called, and he wouldn’t answer his phone. I called the store. Nobody answered the phone. ” “My   called back and said, you know, it’s on the news,” he continues. “I can remember driving  —   and you know, you find yourself begging: Please, God, don’t let it be him. Don’t let it be him. And then you go from that to making deals with God. God, just let him be OK and I’ll do whatever you want. You make deals with God and beg God. ” “I parked on the edge of the Quick Trip property and as I got out of the jeep, of his other managers was getting out of his car as he saw me drive up, and I came over asking: Where’s Grant? Where’s my son? And the tears were coming out of his eyes, and I knew. I knew Grant was gone. ” WATCH:  “There is no reality,” Ronnebeck says. “You don’t think it’s real. I couldn’t fathom that my son had been killed. ” Surveillance video captured Grant’s last moments: Police said surveillance video showed Altamirano walking into the QT about 4 a. m. Thursday and asking Ronnebeck for a pack of cigarettes. Ronnebeck asked several times what type of cigarettes, and Altamirano pointed to a pack behind the counter, a Mesa police officer said. Altamirano then dumped a jar of coins onto the counter and Ronnebeck told him he needed to pay for the cigarettes first, the officer said. Altamirano became agitated and pulled a gun and pointed it at Ronnebeck, who then tried to hand the suspect the pack of cigarettes. Altamirano said, “You’re not going to give me my cigarettes,” and fired one shot into Ronnebeck. Altamirano calmly walked behind the counter, over Ronnebeck’s body and grabbed several packs of cigarettes before slowly walking out of the store. “My son’s death was completely preventable,” Ronnebeck says. Apolinar Altamirano had been in the country illegally since he was 14 and was a   member of the Sinola drug cartel and the Mexican mafia. He had previously been arrested for sexually assaulting a woman, breaking into her house, sexually assaulting her, holding her captive for a week. And he was able to plead it down to  felony burglary. ” Apolinar Altamirano was on day 492 of his bond. He should have been deported shortly after he was off probation, if not sooner. So this system that was installed by Obama’s executive action cost caused the lag in the deportation hearing. And it basically wasn’t even scheduled. Altamirano’s age and   “childhood arrival” as a teenager would have made him eligible for Barack Obama’s unilateral “DREAMer” amnesty if he didn’t have a felony record. Given the Obama administration’s reckless disregard for American lives and public safety, along with the scale of Obama’s amnesty, it’s not inconceivable that Altamirano’s criminal history would have been overlooked, especially since the Obama administration has refused to even place detainers on other illegal aliens who have killed Americans. Illegal immigration costs taxpayers billions and billions of dollars, along with Americans’ lives. “The cost to us goes way beyond dollars. It’s costing us our sons and our daughters, our parents, our loved ones. ” (Courtesy of Steve Ronnebeck) Ronnebeck slams Obama for lavishing benefits on illegal aliens as well: For eight years, we’ve had a president who’s danced all over the Constitution. He’s written an illegal law. An unconstitutional law. He’s wrapped it up in a presidential seal and called it an executive action and shoved it down the American people’s throats. ” This is about my son, Grant. This is about Brian Mendoza. This is about Kate Steinle. This is about Shayley Estes. This is about Spencer Golvach. This is about Dominic Durden. Their deaths were preventable. No parent wants their child to be remembered for what happened to them. So I don’t think I want him remembered for that, but I’m hoping he can be remembered for the smile. For all the people’s lives he made better, whether it be for two minutes at work, whether it be his brother he impacted for the rest of his life. For me, who impacted for the rest of my life. I want him to be remembered for his kind heart, his smile, and just the good person he was. And secondly, I’d like him to be remembered for getting change,” Ronnebeck adds. “And to prevent somebody else “from going through what me and my family had to go through. ” The Grant Ronnebeck Foundation, created in Grant’s name, will provide financial assistance for burial expenses and other costs for families who lost loved ones to illegal alien criminals. The mainstream media largely ignores Americans hurt, maimed, or murdered by illegal aliens, most of whom arrive from backwards, violent, corrupt countries. Breitbart News has extensively covered shocking cases of depraved criminal acts committed by illegals during the Obama administration years: Breitbart News has also reported   on the massive illegal alien crime wave as the U. S. government continues to import and allow the illegal migration flow from countries with much higher crime rates. Mexico is an exceptionally egregious case: “51, 000 criminal aliens incarcerated in federal prison in December 2010, 68 percent were citizens of Mexico, and almost 90 percent were from one of seven Latin American countries: Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic,” according to a Government Accountability Office report."
20467,20470,39216,North Park University Trump-Inspired ’Hate Crime’ Revealed to Be a Hoax - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,2016-11-25,2016.0,11.0,,"A homophobic “hate crime” supposedly inspired by President elect Donald Trump at North Park University in Chicago has been revealed to be a hoax, according to the university’s president. [The alleged victim, who says she is bisexual, claimed to have received mail that contained a range of homophobic slurs accompanied by the hashtag “#Trump,” according to NBC News.  She claimed to have received a string of anonymous emails which also contained abusive language, adding that the abuse was part of a “country wide epidemic emboldened by this election. ” However, in a letter to students, university president David Parkyn confirmed that the “the incident and related messages were fabricated. ” “We are confident there is no further threat of repeated intolerance to any member of our campus community stemming from this recent incident,” Parkyn continued, adding that the student had now left the university. The incident is not the first example of a hate crime hoax following Donald Trump’s victory. Shortly after his election, a Muslim student was charged for falsely claiming that her hijab was pulled from her head by a Trump supporter. Meanwhile, a black female student from Bowling Green State University has been charged with filing a fake police report after fabricating a story that white Trump supporters had thrown rocks at her in a racially motivated attack.

20507,20510,39256,North Korea: Imprisoned U.S. Student Confessed to ’Severe Crimes’,Breitbart,Mary Chastain,2016-02-29,2016.0,2.0,,"The North Korean government is claiming a U. S. student imprisoned in the hermit kingdom admitted to “severe crimes,” including stealing a propaganda sign. [“I committed the crime of taking out a political slogan from the   area of the Yanggakdo International Hotel,” Otto Warmbier, a student at University of Virginia, told the media in a public appearance choreographed by the North Korean communist government. “I have made the worst mistake of my life, but please act to save me. ”   Warmbier also said a “deaconness” at an Ohio church “offered him a used car worth $10, 000 if he could present a U. S. church with the slogan as a ‘trophy’ from North Korea. ” This same person promised Warmbier $200, 000 for his mother if the country arrested him and he did not return, he allegedly claimed. A senior pastor at Friendship United Methodist Church in Wyoming, OH, Warmbier’s hometown, said that “he did not know the person identified by Warmbier” as a deaconess. He also said the student is “not a member of the congregation. ” Warmbier told the media his crime “is very severe and ” but the authorities have impressed him with their “humanitarian treatment of severe criminals. ” Authorities said Warmbier asked for the press conference. The video brought Warmbier’s parents relief since they have not seen their son in almost two months. “We had not heard from him during these many weeks, so you can imagine how deeply worried we were and what a traumatic experience this has been for us,” stated Fred and Cindy Warmbier. “He seems to be in good health, although we won’t know for sure about his condition until we have a chance to speak with him. ” Their statement added: I hope the fact that he has conveyed his sincere apology for anything that he may have done wrong will now make it possible for the DPRK (North Korea) authorities to allow him to return home. I urge the DPRK government to consider his youth and make an important humanitarian gesture by allowing him to return to his loved ones. The Communist regime arrested Warmbier on January 2 right before his flight back to China. Korean Central News Agency reported the college student traveled as a tourist, but he wanted to destroy “the unity of North Korea with ‘the tacit connivance of the U. S. government. ’” Warmbier booked his trip through Chinese company Young Pioneer Tours. They acknowledged his arrest shortly after it occurred. “We can confirm that the reports that one of our clients is being detained in Pyongyang are true,” the company wrote on its website. “Their family have been informed and we are in contact with the Swedish Embassy, who are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the case. ” The U. S. does not have any diplomatic relations with North Korea. The Swedish Embassy usually “acts as the protecting interest for U. S. citizens. ” Last July, leftist organization ANSWER Coalition offered trips for Americans to North Korea. It promised the trips “will show participants that ‘  mainstream media’ has ‘demonized’ the country’s dictatorship. ” It also encouraged the country to “normalize relations” with the regime. “The best way to learn about any country is to experience it firsthand. This is especially true for the DPRK (North Korea) Cuba, Vietnam and China. Relying on the demonized images presented by the   mainstream media and government mouthpieces is only a recipe for ignorance and hostility,” ANSWER Coalition wrote in an email."
20640,20643,39389,Five Crazy Crimes That Have Occurred at Rio Olympics -- Already,Breitbart,Frances Martel,2016-08-09,2016.0,8.0,,"The Olympics opening ceremonies occurred only days ago, but Rio de Janeiro has already been the scene of some outrageous criminal scenarios, placing athletes, officers, and even   security officials in the line of fire. [Longtime residents of Rio de Janeiro, cariocas, know their city is a hotbed of violent crime. So do Brazil’s officials, who have lamented to international media objecting to the consistent reports of gun deaths that “historically, that is how Rio de Janeiro is. ” Yet the show must go on, and as the days go by, officials and Olympians alike are finding that the violence is not limited to the city’s famed favelas, and that local robbers are as dangerous as fellow athletes and police officers themselves. Below are five criminal events that have occurred in the past week.  A Stray Bullet Made Its Way into an Olympic Equestrian Press Conference, A press conference on Sunday to update reporters on the status of the Olympic equestrian competition was interrupted by a bullet piercing the venue tent. There is no evidence that the shooter attempted to attack equestrian athletes, and police have not identified where the bullet came from. They did narrow it down, however. Defense Minister Raul Jungmann offered reporters, “One hypothesis is that someone who felt they were being filmed and observed made the shot. ” The bullet may also have been meant for a nearby military complex. One rapidly discarded theory: the bullet came from a nearby shooting competition. Whoever shot it was definitely not supposed to be shooting, police confirmed. A Firefighter was Raped by a Security Officer in the Olympic Village While She Slept, This incident occurred before the Olympics technically started, on July 31, when most athletes had already settled into their living headquarters and begun training. The firefighter, too, had gone to sleep after a series of   workdays in her quarters on the Olympic campus when she was interrupted by a security officer. “I woke up with him kissing me and stroking me, almost lying on top of me,” the unidentified firefighter told Brazilian TV, stating she was too tired to physically remove him from her. An Olympic   Athlete Was Expelled from the Olympic Village for Attempted Rape, Police are not the only rape threat within the Olympic Village athletes, too, have been arrested for attempting to rape women on site. Two Olympic boxers have been removed from the Olympic village for attempted rape: Moroccan Hassan Saada, who reportedly attempted to rape two maids working at the complex, and Namibian Jonas Junias Jonas, who also allegedly attempted to rape a housekeeper. Both have been taken out of the village and imprisoned. Jonas was the flagbearer for his country during the Olympic opening games he will not be allowed to compete. The Portuguese Minister of Education Was Mugged  —   and Saved by Cariocas, Portuguese Education Minister Tiago Brandão Rodrigues was leaving an Olympic cycling event Saturday night with his spokeswoman, when a man attacked him, brandishing knives and taking some of his valuables, including his mobile phone. Rodrigues was fortunate not to lose a thing in the attack, however, because local Brazilians saw the incident, tackled the main assailant, and beat him until they managed to retrieve his belongings. The attacker was hospitalized following the incident. “It was just a scare,” Rodrigues told reporters, saying it did not take away from his enjoyment of the Games. The Olympics Head of Security Was Robbed at Knifepoint, If robbers did not spare foreign ministers, it was inevitable they would attack Brazilian officials, as well. Felipe Seixas, the security coordinator for special events in Brazil  —   which makes him the head of the Olympics security  —   was also robbed at gunpoint. Seixas was accompanied by two undercover police, however, who quickly shot one of the assailants dead. Seeing the man killed, the other robbers fled. They have not been caught."
20776,20779,39525,’Angel Moms’ Who Lost Children to Illegal Alien Crimes to Hold Event at Wall Surrounding Paul Ryan’s Home - Breitbart,Breitbart,Julia Hahn,2016-07-22,2016.0,7.0,,"JANESVILLE, WI —   On Saturday, American mothers who have buried their children as a result of illegal alien crime will be holding a press conference in front of Paul Ryan’s personal border wall that protects his family and his estate. [These “angel moms” say that Ryan has ignored the American families that have been torn apart by open borders for too long.  The press event is being organized by both the Remembrance Project —  a   that represents the victims of illegal alien crime and advocates for border security —   and Wisconsin businessman, Paul Nehlen, who is running to unseat Ryan in Wisconsin’s August 9th primary. Nehlen, who has been endorsed by several of the victims, has made Ryan’s support for open borders immigration policies a central focus of his campaign. Nehlen has said that while Ryan protects his family and his home with a border wall, Ryan has denied the American people those same protections. Last year, Ryan’s omnibus spending bill failed to provide funding for the completion of the 700 mile   border fence that Congress promised the American public a decade ago. Earlier this month, Ryan would not commit to bringing up legislation to fund a wall along the southern border to protect America’s families —   even as he was defending his use of his own personal border wall. Ryan said that his border wall is a good idea for his family because he has “three dogs and three kids. ” Following Ryan’s defense, Nehlen issued a statement blasting Ryan for essentially telling “Wisconsin voters that his family deserves the protections afforded by a border wall, but your family does not. ” Nehlen described Ryan’s comments as “more radical and more disturbing than anything John Boehner, Eric Cantor or any other     Washington career politican has ever said about the matter. ” Ryan gets world class security around the clock at the expense of American taxpayers. He protects his family with a border fence, while he ignores the pleas of American mothers and fathers who have desperately begged Congress to secure our border and stop the senseless deaths of our children  …     When Kate Stienle’s father begged Congress to take action, Paul Ryan voted to reward sanctuary cities with federal funding. After 18   Joshua Wilkerson was tortured and murdered by an illegal immigrant youth, Paul Ryan voted to bankroll and rubber stamp President Obama’s 2012 unconstitutional amnesty for illegal immigrant youths  …     Paul Ryan shields himself and his family from the open borders policies that he has spent decades imposing upon the American people. How many more Americans have to die for the open border agenda of Paul Ryan’s donors? The mothers at Saturday’s press event will include Laura Wilkerson, Julie Golvach, Agnes Gibboney, and Michelle Root. On November 16, 2010, Wilkerson’s    son Joshua was tied up, beaten, strangled, set on fire, and tortured to death by his illegal alien classmate while he was on his way home from school. Wilkerson says that her son’s killer would have qualified for Obama’s 2012 executive amnesty for   DREAMers —  i. e. illegal aliens that allegedly entered the country as minors. Ryan “hasn’t done anything to help us,” Wilkerson’s husband, George, has told Breitbart. “His tone is totally against Americans as far as I’m concerned  …     He’s doing more for foreign citizens than he is for his own American citizens. ” Interestingly, in 2013, Ryan said that his job as a U. S. lawmaker is to put himself in the shoes of the illegal alien DREAMer and then craft legislative solutions that best serve the illegal immigrant’s interests. Indeed, last year, Ryan voted to fully fund Obama’s unconstitutional executive amnesty for illegal alien DREAMers. Wilkerson explained that Ryan insulates his family from the immigration policies he forces upon the American people, who can’t afford big fences and exclusive schools like Ryan can: [Ryan’s] got all the protection in the world: Secret Service, big houses with fences, private schools for his kids where they don’t have to deal with all of the people they’re dumping into our cities and towns. He doesn’t have to deal with any of this. He’s got all the protections in the world  …     On January 31, 2015, Julie Golvach’s 25   son, Spencer, was murdered by an illegal alien. Spencer was shot in the head while stopped at a red light. Nehlen has noted that on Father’s Day, Golvach’s father, Dan, had asked “Ryan to accompany him to the place where Dan will spend every Father’s Day for the rest of his life —  his son’s grave. Dan wrote: ‘This way Speaker Ryan can see first hand what pandering to the cheap illegal labor lobby means to Americans who can’t afford to put a security fence up around their house.’ But Paul Ryan ignored Dan’s plea. ” On April 27, 2002, Agnes Gibboney’s son, 29   son Ronald Da Silva, was standing in his girlfriend’s driveway talking to a friend when he was suddenly shot and killed by a previously deported illegal alien. Gibboney says that she supports building a border wall to protect American communities and told the Los Angeles Times, “I want to lay the first brick if I can. ” On January 31, 2016, Michelle Root’s   old daughter, Sarah, was murdered by a drunk illegal alien from Honduras who was street racing in a 35 mph zone. Sarah was killed the day after she had graduated college with a 4. 0 GPA. The illegal alien   Sarah’s vehicle at more than 70 mph —   severing her spine and breaking her skull in two places. After Sarah had been murdered by a drunk illegal alien driver, Ryan told Bill O’Reilly that the reason the House hadn’t pushed Kate’s Law —   named in honor of Kate Steinle —  was because he didn’t want to be “clogging up our jails” with illegal alien drunk drivers. Root’s killer had entered the country illegally as an “unaccompanied child” at the age of 16 and was released into the interior. Last year, Ryan voted to fund the President Obama’s resettlement of illegal immigrant border crossers into the interior of the U. S. In stark contrast to Speaker Ryan —   who has been accused of ignoring these families and working against their interests —  the Republican Party’s nominee, Donald Trump, has become their champion. In his Thursday night acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump named just a few of the American victims specifically and said: “I’ve met Sarah’s [Sarah Root’s] beautiful family. But to this Administration, their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn’t worth protecting. One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders. ” Trump continued: Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann [Mendoza] Sabine [Durden] and Jamiel [Shaw]? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate.

20956,20959,39705,O’Malley: We Can’t Let Trump ’Commit War Crimes’ or Fill Prison ’Internment Camps’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,2016-11-11,2016.0,11.0,,"Friday on  MSNBC’s “Hardball,” former Democratic presidential candidate and former Gov.

21545,21548,40295,"NRA-Backed Program Cut Crime in Tim Kaine’s Richmond, Virginia",Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2016-10-07,2016.0,10.0,,"National Rifle   (NRA) Project Exile was implemented and drastically cut crime during Tim Kaine’s tenure as mayor of Richmond, Virginia. [At the time of the program’s implementation, Richmond was giving Chicago a run for its money regarding gun violence. But the program brought stiff penalties for criminals with guns, even when the gun was simply in criminal possession, whether used in the commission of a crime or not, and crime decreased.  On February 10, 1999, The New York Times quoted Mayor Tim Kaine saying, “In Richmond, there has been an intense need for people to become believers in their own community. High crime has been our psychological downer. But Project Exile is driving the crime down, and that is starting to make Richmonders believe again. ” Project Exile was the brainchild of assistant U. S. Attorney David Schiller, and it was heavily promoted and pushed by the NRA. In the first two years of its implementation, “475 illegal guns” were recovered, and there were “indictments against 404 people in gun charges —  more than six times the annual average. ” The resulting conviction rate was “86 percent,” and the “average prison term [was] more than four and a half years. ” Under Project Exile, the number of homicides in Richmond fell to “78” in 1998. That was a 36 percent decrease from the year before. The Times described it as “one of the steepest declines in any city. ” In short, Project Exile took criminals off the streets. And when Hillary Clinton picked Kaine as her running mate, some warned that his past support of Project Exile could cause problems for the ticket. For example, Reuters was referencing Project Exile when it described that Kaine embraced “  strategies that have driven up the U. S. prison population and are unpopular in the black community. ” Campaign Zero   Sam Sinyangwe said, “Project Exile broke black families. This is not a benign thing to be for. These measures were not used against white kids in the suburbs with guns, they were used against black kids in the cities. ” But Kaine supported Project Exile, and it served him well by lowering crime under his watch. However, the same Kaine who supported Project Exile is now a vocal opponent of    when Donald Trump suggests using the tactic to target criminals in Chicago. In the transcript of the October 4 vice presidential debate, published by The Washington Post, Kaine said, “Donald Trump recently said we need to do more    around the country. That would be a big mistake because it polarizes the relationship between the police and the community. ” Kaine also credited the drop in crime during his stint as mayor to “community policing. ” In this, he is criticizing Trump for supporting the kind of policing that actually worked in Richmond, while subsequently claiming a more gentle approach to policing is what worked in Richmond. As The Washington Times observed, “Tim Kaine didn’t tell the whole truth about crime in Richmond. ” People are dying at an unprecedented rate in Chicago while Kaine pushes more of the failed “community policing” that has proved impotent against criminals. He supported a different solution when he was mayor of Richmond. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

21683,21686,40433,Trey Gowdy: More Illegal Immigrants Convicted of Crimes At Large in the U.S. Than The Population of Pittsburgh - Breitbart,Breitbart,Caroline May,2016-04-19,2016.0,4.0,,"There are more illegal immigrant criminals in the United States than the population of major U. S. cities, Rep. Trey Gowdy ( ) argues, expressing frustration at the Obama administration’s focus on the plight of illegal immigrants rather than the victims of their crimes. [“Today there are over 350, 000 known criminal aliens in the United States who are not detained by ICE, 350, 000,” Gowdy, the chairman of the Immigration and Border Security Subcommittee, said opening a hearing examining the victims of illegal immigrant crime.  “That number may not get your attention  —   statistics rarely do  —   so I want you to think about it this way. The number of criminal aliens living in the United States, not in custody, not separated from society, it larger than the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Larger than the city of Lexington, Kentucky, larger than the city of Anaheim, California,” he asked. “Can you imagine a city the size of Pittsburgh, comprised sole of people who are here unlawfully who have also committed another crime?” Gowdy noted that, according to ICE, between October 2011 and December 2014, ICE released criminal aliens over 100, 000 times. “According to ICE those released have been convicted of more than 10, 000 assaults, more than 800 sexual assaults, more than 400   offenses, and more than 300 kidnappings,” he said. Gowdy slammed the Obama administration’s effort to provide unilateral amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants as immigration enforcement falls by the wayside. The South Carolina lawmaker took particular umbrage at an argument Solicitor General Donald Verrilli made before the Supreme Court Monday, arguing for Obama’s executive amnesty programs. “Just yesterday the lawyer for the president was at it again, this time at the United States Supreme Court, arguing for the nonenforcement of the law, arguing for the wholesale failure to enforce the law,” Gowdy said. “And he said this: ‘The damage that would be reeked by tearing apart families.’ If you want to see that damage, Mr. Solicitor General, if you want to see what tearing apart looks like, I hope you’re watching this morning. ” Two mothers of children killed by illegal immigrants offered emotional testimony Tuesday before the hearing over which Gowdy presided."
21922,21925,40672,"U.S. Official: Gulen Islamic Schools ’Organized Crime,’ Not ’Benign Religious Movement’",Breitbart,Frances Martel,2016-11-01,2016.0,11.0,,"An unnamed “senior U. S. State Department official” told reporters Tuesday that American law enforcement evidence suggests that Turkish Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen operates his charter schools like an “organized crime” syndicate, not a religious group, and that Turkey’s demands to extradite Gulen for criminal activity “may have some merit. ”[The government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen of orchestrating the failed coup d’etat defeated on July 15 and infiltrating the nation’s military, civilian law enforcement, and educational infrastructure to establish a “cult” to Gulen within Turkey.  The Turkish newspaper Hurriyet cites the unnamed official as saying that Gulen’s Hizmet Islamic organization operates “a lot like the ways in which organized crime sets itself up by folks who are trying to hide money for money laundering,” rather than what it presents itself as: “a benign religious movement. ” He added that Turkey’s claims that Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, should be extradited for his role in the failed coup “may have some merit,” though he did not elaborate. Hizmet supporters describe the movement as “a ‘  collectivity’ with millions of followers and sympathizers who draw on Islamic spirituality and teaching, constituting one of the largest civil movements. ” The movement operates more than 1, 000 schools worldwide, including 150 in the United States, which operate on taxpayer subsidies. Gulen himself argues that Hizmet (“service”) is a moderate Islamic alternative that has a role to play in the eradication of radical Islam. Gulen opponents, including the government of Turkey, argue that, instead, Hizmet is a cult centered around Gulen in which adherents are encouraged to aid in the overthrow of the Turkish government to establish Gulen as the nation’s leader. The U. S. government has not weighed in officially on these accusations, though America’s Hizmet schools have run into problems of their own. The FBI raided 19 of the schools in 2014, citing discrepancies in the group’s finances. The Turkish government has made multiple official requests for Gulen’s extradition, citing the July 15 coup attempt and comparing the Hizmet movement to the Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, calling them both “CIA projects. ” Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag visited Washington last week to personally encourage his American counterpart Loretta Lynch to begin the extradition process. In public comments, Bozdag compared Gulen to Osama bin Laden, citing him as an equivalent danger to the stability of the Turkish government. “Whatever Osama bin Laden means for the United States and the American people, Fethullah Gulen means the same for Turkey and the Turkish people,” he said, comparing the coup attempt to “an assassination attempt on President Obama and his family, where the White House was bombed [and]   …     tanks were marching the streets [and]   …     241 U. S. civilians were killed and around 3, 000 were wounded. ” While Turkey has sent thousands of files to Washington related to the Gulen case, by late August, American officials confirmed that none of those documents appeared to have anything to do with the failed coup. “The evidence is crystal clear. We know the terrorist cult responsible for the vicious attacks against us and the Turkish people. We simply cannot understand why the U. S. cannot just hand over this individual,” Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said at the time, shortly before U. S. officials  —   and Turkish government spokespeople  —   confirmed that they had not yet compiled evidence linking Gulen to the coup. Last week, Turkish officials said they finally handed over the relevant evidence regarding Gulen and the failed coup. Meanwhile, the Turkish government has continued to crack down on individuals and media organizations it claims has an affiliation to Gulen. This week, Turkish police shut down 15 media outlets and arrested multiple senior staffers at the newspaper Cumhuriyet, the nation’s premier secularist opposition newspaper. Cumhuriyet grew to international recognition after facing government suppression for agreeing to publish a   inset of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo following a jihadist attack on its headquarters. Cumhuriyet later published a report accusing Turkey’s intelligence agency, the MIT, of supplying weapons to Syrian rebels. For that, the newspaper’s    Can Dündar, received a   prison sentence. Dündar eventually escaped to Germany. Turkey has arrested, detained, or fired from state jobs more than 100, 000 people in relation to Gulen and the July 15 coup attempt."

[According to Politico, Senator Tim Kennedy ( ) recounted Clinton’s words, saying:  She said she wants to work to get illegal guns off the street and said it’s been part of her work as an elected official to strengthen laws to keep America safe. She said that it’s going to be coming out in the very near future that many of the catastrophes that have taken human lives in the State of New York have been the product of guns coming over the border from Vermont. Kennedy said Clinton’s claim about guns from Vermont having a significant tie to New York crime was news to him. He said, “That’s the first I heard it. I think it caught everybody’s attention and we’re looking forward to learning more about it. ” Clinton’s challenger for the Democrat presidential nomination, Bernie Sanders, is a Senator from Vermont. On September 17, 2015, Governor Andrew Cuomo said New York gun crime was the fault of southern states. The New York Daily News quoted Cuomo saying, “The cruel irony here is that we passed the toughest gun control law in the country here in New York. ” He was referencing the SAFE Act, which requires firearm registration, bans “assault rifles,” bans “high capacity” ammunition magazines, and expands background checks, all under the guise of reducing gun violence. Cuomo added, “[But] as long as you can get a gun from some state down south, put it in a trunk and drive it up, it’s gonna get into this state, and that’s what’s happening. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and political analyst for Armed American Radio.

Following the accusation, Lafayette police said there were no witnesses or surveillance footage to back up the story. After the New York Times, Times Picayune, Washington Post and Huffington Post all ran with the woman’s claims, Lafayette police said the entire story was fabricated, as Breitbart Texas reported. “During the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,” Lafayette police said in a statement. “This incident is no longer under investigation by the Lafayette Police Department. ” Now, the Muslim student is being charged with filing a fake police report, as a Lafayette police spokesman confirmed to  . The police spokesman said the department would not be releasing the woman’s name, despite giving no reason as to why. The spokesman also said he did not have any information on the case.

A report by the     Human Rights Commission also cited increasing detentions of Central American migrants and attacks on journalists and human rights workers, many of which occurred under the administration of President Enrique Pena Nieto, who took office in 2012. The report praised some recent judicial reforms, but said they haven’t really been implemented yet. “Despite the change in administration in December 2012, in practice there have been no substantial changes with regard to security policies and the violence levels,” the report said. “Of particular concern are the reports of disappearances, extrajudicial executions and torture. ” The commission acknowledged that Mexico had made significant constitutional and legislative reforms but said that everywhere it went during its visit “it met with victims, family members, and defenders, who described the barriers that they have run up against in their quest for justice, as well as their distrust of the authorities. ” Police are often believed to be ineffective, or in league with criminals. The report notes that 98 percent of crimes go unpunished in Mexico. “Family members’ discoveries of mass graves with dozens of bodies underscore that they are the ones who have undertaken the search for their loved ones given the State’s ineffectiveness,” the report said. It also cited three cases in which survivors have accused Mexican security forces of essentially executing suspects. The government acknowledged problems, but said the report “unfortunately does not reflect the general situation in the country, and starts off from erroneous premises and diagnoses. ” The government suggested the problems were localized and said “there is no crisis of human rights in our country. ”  "

[The conservative MP has picked up on the fact the Germans went to great lengths to “cover up the crimes of their Arab guests, or even shift the blame upon themselves” ever since their arrival, for the sake of keeping the German public on Merkel’s side.  Prof. Pawłowicz further pointed out how in the interest of keeping the lefty spirits up, the “Berlin Gay Pride event went ahead despite the mourning in Munich” suggesting the Germans have already adjusted to the “new normal” of living with terrorism without even being instructed by their politicians to do so. That is in complete contrast to how the French dismissed the advice to “live with terrorism” by Manuel Valls. “Europe is ill and bleeding. We [Poland] survive with God’s help” said Prof Pawłowicz in the context of the World Youth Day celebrated by the Catholic youth currently converged from all over the world in Krakow, whilst pointing to the “white flag” and “colour pencil protest” attitude in France, Belgium and Germany, all of whom “rejected God in favour of a misunderstood liberty”. Picking up on the German CDU parliamentary deputy Armin Schuster’s statement that “Germany needs a culture of farewell (Abschiedskultur) as opposed to the culture of welcome (Wilkommenskultur)” Pawłowicz expressed her doubts that the “German culture still has it in it to win against the alien culture in the struggle for the European territory which we are witnessing”.  Commenting on Pope Francis’ homily in Krakow about “strengthening of Catholics’ faith” Pawłowicz implored that Poles “should continue to defend the Cross and continue to help the needy in the geographic locations where the help is needed”.  She made clear, however, that it is a Polish duty “to defend the Cross, not the Crescent” and that “if the Poles don’t survive in Poland [due to the immigrant invasion spearheaded by Merkel] then no one else will defend the Cross in their place” a powerful statement from a declared Catholic, and yet another Catholic voice seemingly at odds with Pope Francis’. These comments were made before Angela Merkel reinforced her stance on support for the uncontrolled immigration, despite the clear failure of that policy. Hence, even more criticism should be expected from Poland in the coming days."

[During a rally in North Carolina on Sunday, Pence taled about FBI Director James Comey, shortly after news broke that Comey issued a written that the bureau had “not changed” its conclusions that Clinton should not face indictment over her raucous email scandal.  Speaking at the Hickory Regional Airport, Pence said, “You have a   general that might get five years in prison, before the end of this year, for mishandling classified information,” of retired Gen. James Cartwright who was charged with lying to the FBI about discussing classified information with reporters about Iran’s nuclear program, during a probe. Pence continued, “you have a sailor that just went to jail for taking a    photographs in a classified area of a nuclear submarine. So let me say this, if only for their decades of   with the politics of personal enrichment, mishandling classified information and compromising our national security, we must ensure that Hillary Clinton is never elected president of the United States of America. ” Pence declared, “the American people have had enough,” “and they have especially had enough of the fast and loose ethics of Bill and Hillary Clinton. ” The crowd enthusiastically chanted, “Lock her up!” FBI Director James Comey issued the bureau’s conclusion through a written statement on Sunday. This second probe into Clinton’s emails was conducted using classified materials that were unearthed in emails found in the Anthony Weiner underage sexting investigation. Comey wrote, “Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton. ” Pence was not having it. “Ladies and gentlemen, mishandling classified information is a crime. ” He reminded the audience that “Hillary Clinton said there’s nothing marked classified on her emails, sent or received, and the FBI director told to Congress, that’s not true. ” He also pointed out that Clinton said she did not email any classified information to anyone. “And the head of the FBI told to Congress, there was classified information that was emailed. ” Separate emails also indicated that a top State Department official had attempted to offer the FBI quid pro quo if the bureau agreed to let Clinton alter the classified status of the documents found on her private server. RNC chairman Reince Priebus issued a statement to Breitbart News, following Comey’s announcement, making it clear that the FBI’s public corruption investigation of the Clinton Foundation  —   which has raised billions of dollars  —   is ongoing: The FBI’s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton’s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment. The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct. None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state. Hillary Clinton should never be president.

23645,23649,42400,Muslim’s Tale of Subway Terror from Trump Supporters Exposed as a Faux Hate Crime and Fake News - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel J. Flynn,2016-12-14,2016.0,12.0,,"Yasmin Seweid disappeared. Then her story did. [The Baruch College freshman’s tale of subway harassment by a trio of inebriated Donald   assailants unraveled on Wednesday after New York City police failed to find a single witness or any security footage corroborating the teen’s colorful account.  “Trump America is real and I witnessed it first hand last night!” Seweid wrote on Facebook on December 2. “What a traumatizing night. ” The trauma allegedly included the intoxicated triumvirate ripping a strap from a handbag and attempting to pull the hijab from her head. All the while, they chanted “Trump! Trump!” and issued such insulting comments as, “Look, it’s a f —  ing terrorist” and “Get the hell out of the country!” “It breaks my heart that so many individuals chose to be bystanders while watching me get harassed verbally and physically by these disgusting pigs,” Seweid declared on her Facebook page, which, like her, ultimately became inaccessible in the aftermath of the story. The truth, too, proved elusive, as Seweid clung to her story for nearly two weeks before confessing to the hoax on Wednesday. The cops charged her with two misdemeanors, obstructing governmental administration and filing a false report, that each potentially carries a year behind bars upon conviction. The fact that the political demographics in Manhattan don’t exactly match Montana’s made the entire saga difficult to digest. In the big borough on the tiny island where the faux incident supposedly took place, Clinton   supporters outnumbered Trump voters 515, 481 to 58, 935. But Make America Great Again enthusiasts apparently peopled this particular subway car, with onlookers refusing to intervene and three Trump supporters feeling comfortable in Clinton Country to terrorize a beautiful young woman in public. With such inconvenient truths clashing with an    narrative, true believers believed. “The incident is another in a growing list of bias crimes across the city since Trump’s election,” the New York Daily News reported. “Yasmin’s experience seems to be one of the growing number of racially motivated attacks that have occurred in the wake of Donald Trump’s surprise electoral victory,” Rafi Schwartz wrote at Fusion. Buzzfeed, which apparently neglects to add an “alleged” when the accused support the   elected to headline its story on the matter: “Drunk Men Yelling ‘Donald Trump’ Attempt To Remove Woman’s Hijab On NYC Subway. ” The story now gets scrubbed away like its author’s Facebook page. But the narrative remains. On MSNBC Wednesday night, Joy Reid asked of hate crimes against Muslim Americans, “How do we know those crimes will be continued to be prosecuted?” Filling in for Rachel Maddow, Reid played footage of the regular host’s interview with Attorney General Loretta Lynch. “In terms of   hate crimes, [it’s] the biggest upsurge since ” Maddow claimed, which provoked a lengthy response from Lorretta Lynch on how Muslims constitute “our neighbors and friends and family members. ” They certainly do for Yasmin Seweid, whose father noted her late arrival home on December 1. Kids say the darndest things to escape the wrath of a strict Muslim parent —  especially when their clandestine date with a Christian runs past curfew. It was no hate crime. It was a crime of passion."
24093,24097,42848,Lower-Income Whites and Blacks Unite In Fear As Crime Soars Under Barack Obama - Breitbart,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,2016-04-12,2016.0,4.0,,"A growing majority of   Americans  —   and especially    —   are worried a great deal about rising crime, according to a new poll. [But there’s little extra concern declared by       Americans about rising crime or   reaching into their neighborhoods.  The Gallup poll discovered that 53 percent of respondents say they now “worry a great deal” about rising rates of crime and violence. That is a rapid rise  —   in 2014,  just 39 percent were worried a” great deal” as they are today. Concern among   independents rose from 36 percent to 53 percent. Among Republicans, the “great deal” number rose 15 points up to 53 percent, bringing it level with the 52 percent concern among Democrats. Seventy percent of people with just   degrees  —   but only 32 percent of people with college degrees  —   said they were worried a great deal about crime. Those two numbers have risen by 20 points and 1 point, respectively, since 2014. Concern among   people has risen by 20 points since 2014, up to 57 percent. Among   people, concern has apparently risen by only eight points, to merely 36 percent. GOP   and populist Donald Trump has made the rising   a major part of his campaign for the GOP nomination. Last year, Trump angered liberals when he said we need to “give power back” to our police officers in order to fight the rising crime. He added to that claim when he said “police are the most mistreated people in America. ” Trump has been so   he even claimed he’d support a policy of making the death penalty mandatory for killing police officers. But when the numbers are broken down farther it appears   respondents are far more worried than whites.   percent of whites worry a great deal about crime, but 68 percent of   are worried a great deal. As Powerline’s Paul Mirengoff notes, “The reason for the disparities seems obvious. Crime, violence, and drugs afflict nonwhite communities more than white ones. ” Gallup has asked the crime question since 2001. At that time 62 percent said they worried a great deal about crime but by 2002 it had fallen to 49 percent. By 2014 it fell even further to only 39 percent. But the worries started rising again in 2015 coinciding with a spike in national murder rates, growing complaints by police, and a series of violent, destructive riots that were largely ignored by President Barack Obama. A recent report in The Washington Post found the number of homicides in the country’s 50 largest cities is up 17 percent, the greatest increase in 25 years. Despite the apparent lack of concern among   people, there’s some evidence that liberal Americans are growing more concerned about crime. For example, a Democratic staffer recently told The Washington Post that she is taking   classes to protect herself from rising crime in her neighborhood and nationwide. Melanie Rainer, the staffer, helped win confirmation for Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who is now pushing Obama’s    agenda. In an article in The Washington Post, Rainer talked about how scared she is to live in Washington, D. C. because there are just too many crimes in her area. “There were so many incidents,” Rainer said. “It’s alarming   …     We’d check every day and there would be another incident a block from our house. ” The article goes on to describe the   classes the staffer took and quoted her saying, “There has been an increase in crime. It’s an indisputable fact. ” In 2015, violent crime jumped by roughly 20 percent in some areas of D. C. including the Capitol Hill and the Adams Morgan district of bars and apartments. The Washington Post reported on the local trend in October, saying, Sarah Pitluck used to walk her dogs before dawn, among the early risers exercising on Capitol Hill. She now waits until first light, and for the streets to be busier. It is just one way the young man who robbed her, ripping the smartphone from her hand and scratching her neck, has changed her daily routine  —   and her life. Ever since the Oct. 13 robbery just two blocks from her home, the pharmaceutical executive goes to work later and comes home before it gets dark. Lost time at her office is made up at home, on the phone with her overseas staffers and answering  . She drives more often and pairs with others on neighborhood excursions. Her poodle, Lenzi, and Chihuahua mix, Pedro, get walks only during daylight hours. A recent wave of street robberies has scared residents of this neighborhood that stretches out from the U. S. Capitol, spilling into Hill East and the Navy Yard neighborhood and up to the H Street corridor. Attackers have stolen not only cellphones and money, but also a sense of security. The national crime spike comes as Obama and his progressive allies have rolled back enforcement of laws by stigmatizing cops, almost halting the normal repatriation of criminal illegal immigrants and by refusing to prosecute many crimes. Gallup also asked people about rising drug use.   percent of whites say they’re worried a “great deal,” up from 27 percent in 2014.   percent of people without college education said they were worried a “great deal”  —   creating a huge   gap with 22 percent of   people who worry a “great deal” about drugs.   percent of   say they’re worried about drugs a great deal, actually down three points from 52 percent in 2014.

[Noting that the “lone wolf” Berlin jihadi is turning out to be a “known wolf” who was under surveillance by German authorities, SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam asked Jasser why more is not being done to thwart Islamist terrorism.  “Because the current axis upon which we focus is violence,” Jasser replied. “Currently all they’re looking for is when these guys get turned on to commit an act of violence, and most of them have no ability to demonstrate that they’re going to be violent. ”  “But they are Islamists, they are insurgents,” he argued. “They reject Western systems. They’re very    . They divide the world into the land of Islam and the land of war. But that ideology is not monitored. All we’re monitoring is trying to figure out when they’re all of a sudden going to become violent, and most of them only demonstrate that a few hours or, at most, a few days, before they commit the act. ”  “That’s why we need to start monitoring the public footprint of political Islam, and what is that? It’s the grievance groups that say Muslims are discriminated against and that the West is Islamophobic,” said Jasser. “It’s the  . It’s the misogyny, where women are treated as   citizens, and you see them talking about the right to wear the veil, rather than the right for women to have independence and bodily autonomy. ”  “All these things that the governments of France and Germany and Britain and the U. S. would perceive as simply shades of theology need to be monitored and looked at in a public footprint perspective. Then you’d be able to say, ‘Oh, these are the guys that could become militarized or operationalized.’ Otherwise, there’s no way to predict it,” he warned. “They’re using such unconventional means now, since ISIS is telling them to use trucks and knives and things that would not be able to be monitored, that we have to be looking at the precursor ideologies  —   which is the hate for the West, the hate for the system that really is out there. ”  “As you know, in the work that I do, I attract most of these barbaric Islamists. Look at the Paris attacks. The Paris attacks occurred in November, and in March, the same cell committed a second act. These guys hid out in Islamist insurgent communities. Not militant communities, but insurgent communities that protected them from the police. That tells you how big the problem is. And this guy now is probably similar. I guarantee you he’s not hiding out in churches or synagogues,” Jasser said. Kassam spotlighted the recent media frenzy over a Muslim prankster allegedly getting kicked off an airplane, allegedly just because he spoke in Arabic, although he has been called out for staging a   hoax. Kassam contended there were real acts of discrimination against Muslims, but their number is much smaller than activists and hoaxers claim. “Does this make it easier or harder for everyday Muslims?” he asked. “I can’t tell you how much harder it makes it,” Jasser replied. “We, right away, on my Twitter feed and on Facebook, exposed quickly that this guy was a prankster, and obviously, he had been outed as a hoax he had committed in 2014, and was just trying to get attention as a YouTuber. People may say he’s not an Islamist, but this is the first stage, 101 or 201 of Islamism, which is to exploit a   society, to exploit its vulnerability  —   which is the protection of minorities  —   and then mock it, separate Muslims out of that society into our own consciousness. ”  “So what happens is, by mocking it and exploiting it, and then saying. ‘Oh, he was discriminated and kicked off,’ but actually lying about it, not only is it a ‘crying wolf’ phenomenon, where those who may be discriminated against are going to be ignored, but it soaks up the bandwidth of what we should be doing,” he explained. “I’ve always said, if you want to melt away any fear of Muslims, the best way is for Americans to see us leading the battle against radicals, for Americans to see us basically recognizing that this is a Muslim problem that needs a Muslim solution,” he advised. “Then they’d say, ‘Oh, wait a minute: these are our allies they’re not our enemies!’ But until we do that, these guys are actually radicalizing our community by telling everyone, ‘Well, make it up or whatever. ’”  “Grievances are our biggest problem,” Jasser mused. “The elephant in the room, even from the discussion you and I just had on Berlin, is that our   allies  —   the Islamic Republic of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, these huge cauldrons of tens and hundreds of millions of Islamists that believe in the Islamic State  —   want to separate the world into good and evil, Islam being good and the rest being evil. Unless we address that primary theocracy  —   which is a mentality that secular society is evil, and if you live here, then, well, Americans hate you, et cetera  —   those types of mentalities can’t be defeated. ”  “We have to abandon that and say, ‘You know what? We’re done with the grievance mills. They are corrupt.’ We need to no longer identify as a collective as Muslims, but identify as Americans first. That’s the main core harm that’s happening with these types of wackos,” he said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN: "

C  —   In an exclusive video interview at the presidential suite of the historic Watergate Hotel, the victims of Bill Clinton’s alleged sexual assault   —   Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, and Paula Jones  —   got together for the first time in person to express their personal fear of Hillary Clinton and to warn voters that Clinton does not stand for women’s issues.  The three women, who say their lives were forever changed by their experiences with the Clintons, used words like “terrified” and “frightened” to describe their feelings about the prospects of a Hillary Clinton presidency. Watch the video here: When asked about the   that their allegations toward Bill Clinton only dig up past “infidelities,” all three women attacked establishment media figures for using this language. “We were not willing participants,” Broaddrick said. “These were crimes. ” In a separate interview, Broaddrick shared her own story of brutal sexual assault which she says Bill Clinton perpetrated against her. Willey called out NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell and CNN’s Jake Tapper by name, challenging them: “These are not infidelities. A rape is not an infidelity. These are crimes. Any other people would be in jail  …      “This is no longer about infidelities, indiscretions, girlfriends, sex, interns  —   none of those. This is about a serial rapist, a predator, and his wife who has enabled his behavior all of these years. ” Later in this interview, Jones, Willey, and Broaddrick expressed fear at how a potential President Hillary Clinton would use the power of her office. “It terrifies me and it should terrify all women,” Jones stated about Hillary’s presidential ambitions. “It should terrify all men and women,” Willey added. “She will annihilate any enemy. All of her enemies. Anybody who has spoken against her. Across the board for I don’t know how many years. She will get rid of them. ” “No woman who advocates for women attacks the victims of sexual assault be it by her husband or anybody else,” said Willey. The women argued that the term “enabler” best describes Hillary Clinton’s role in her husband’s alleged sexual crimes. “There is not a better word for any of this,” stated Broaddrick. “Especially when she threatened me personally. ” Willey added, “She is complicit in everything that he has done. ” “She had helped him do it,” asserted Jones. “She has turned a blind eye for decades against what he has done” stated Broaddrick. “And she has been the main one to help cover this up. And go after us. ” Willey and Jones both accused Bill Clinton of sexual assault, with Willey saying that she suffered acts of intimidation in what she has described as a campaign to silence her. Broaddrick says that Bill Clinton raped her, and recently stated in an interview with this reporter that she was raped twice during the same 1978 alleged assault. "
24653,24657,43409,"Paul Ryan to Take Up Prison Break Bill Amid Crime Wave, Cop Shootings - Breitbart",Breitbart,Katie McHugh,2016-07-18,2016.0,7.0,,"House Speaker Paul Ryan intends to bring up legislation that would reduce sentences for federal prison inmates. [The bill is expected in September, even though a companion bill has stalled in the Senate. Meanwhile, murder rates are spiking in major U. S. cities and cops are being targeted and killed in American cities.  But Ryan and liberal media allies who also support less harsh penalties for criminals will focus instead on seeming racial inequalities and why drug traffickers are in poverty after being released from federal prison. In a recent NPR interview, Ryan tried to explain his position. “Some people have raised questions about   …     whether there’s been a double standard over time,” asked host Steve Inskeep. “In the ’80s when there was a focus on drugs in the black community, people focused on prisons. Now people are concerned in the white community, and it’s about treatment and public health. What’s happening there?” “No, I think you need to complement this with criminal justice reform. I agree with that, as well. That’s something we’re working on for September,” Ryan answered. “Just this week I set up a working group of members from both sides of the aisle to work on community policing ideas, training ideas, but also finishing the job on criminal justice reform so we can get all of those bills out to the floor in September,” he added. Congress “overcompensated” by cracking down on drug trafficking in response to the   crime wave that gripped the nation from 1965 to the nineties. Locking up drug traffickers doesn’t deal with all of the problems, Ryan said: In the 1990s, to your first point, I think government, both Republicans and Democrats, overcompensated on our criminal code. And we went too far and there are disparities  —   crack cocaine vs. powder cocaine  —   there are clear disparities and more importantly, I think that we’ve learned there are better ways of dealing with some of these problems than locking up somebody for 20 or 30 years. You end up ruining their lives, ruining their families, hurting communities, and then when they try to   into society, they’re destitute. “So I really think there are better methods of dealing with these problems and I think that is part of criminal justice reform. I think that’s something I put out in the poverty plan that I first authored three years ago. So we intend on bringing these bills up in September,” he said. Ryan’s position puts him in conflict with the agenda of presumptive GOP nominee Donald Trump. In May during a speech before the National Rifle Association, Trump called out Obama’s plans to spring up to 70, 000 federal prisoners without approval from Congress  —   nearly   of all federal inmates  —   while pushing the   Congress to send him sentencing reform legislation to free even more. “President Obama also tried to take the guns from Americans and yet reduced prosecutions of violent criminals who use guns. President Obama is even releasing violent criminals from the jails, including drug dealers and those with gun crimes,” Trump said. “And they’re being let go by the thousands. By the thousands. Many of these are also —  I’m sure you’re not going to be surprised to hear this —  illegal immigrants. President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous,   felons and gang members who prey on civilians. ” Middle class and lower income whites along with minorities are very concerned about rising crime: In 2014, before Obama launched his “  ” campaign against local and state law enforcement, 39 percent said they were worried “a great deal” about crime. Only two years later, that number soared to 53 percent. Ryan’s criminal justice reform efforts neatly align with his globalist immigration agenda: Sentencing reductions bills pending before Congress will free thousands of illegal alien drug traffickers helping to fuel the violent heroin epidemic back onto American streets, which has prompted critics of the bills to call them a “Trojan horse amnesty. ” One quarter of all those convicted on federal drug trafficking charges last fiscal year were foreign nationals."
24812,24816,43568,War Crimes of Imperial Japan: A Lesson In Moral Equivalence for Mr. Obama - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,2016-05-27,2016.0,5.0,,"President Obama made a single, vague reference to “evil” during his prepared remarks in Hiroshima: “We may not be able to eliminate man’s capacity to do evil, so nations and the alliances that we form must possess the means to defend ourselves. But among those nations like my own that hold nuclear stockpiles, we must have the courage to escape the logic of fear and pursue a world without them. ”[He spoke at length about the horrors experienced by the populace of Hiroshima:   We stand here in the middle of this city and force ourselves to imagine the moment the bomb fell. We force ourselves to feel the dread of children confused by what they see. We listen to a silent cry. We remember all the innocents killed across the arc of that terrible war and the wars that came before and the wars that would follow. Mere words cannot give voice to such suffering. But we have a shared responsibility to look directly into the eye of history and ask what we must do differently to curb such suffering again. “Let all the souls here rest in peace, for we shall not repeat the evil,” he said, when reading the inscription on a monument at the Peace Memorial Park. He somehow forgot to mention the evils perpetrated by Imperial Japan or the unspeakable suffering it inflicted upon POWs and civilians who fell into its clutches.  Let’s correct that oversight, to help the President understand why moral equivalence is the dim refuge of lazy minds, and equating American troops with the Axis forces they defeated is an outrage. Pearl Harbor, We can start with the one everybody knows about: the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor. That was a war crime, Mr. Obama, as very clearly stated in the relevant international laws of the day. It was accompanied by equally illegal bombings against Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines, as part of a very deliberate Japanese strategy. In Hiroshima, Obama’s sole criticism of the Empire of Japan was some mumbled mush about “mistakes of the past,” and that wasn’t even exclusively directed at the Japanese. Nothing they did was a mistake. Mr. Obama, who claims to be a lawyer and devotee of international law, may be interested to know that every single one of the 3, 581 casualties at Pearl Harbor (according to the National WWII Museum tally) were considered   including the 2, 403 military personnel who were killed, because Japan did not declare war before the attack. If it happened today, it would be rightly denounced as a terrorist attack. The Bataan Death March, Here’s another one every American school kid should know about: the Bataan Death March. There was no swift death for the thousands of Americans and Filipinos under siege by Japanese forces in the Philippines. They were already sick and starving when they surrendered to the Japanese. In an act of pure, deliberate sadism, because they were enraged by stiff American resistance during the siege, the Japanese forced their prisoners to march a hundred miles to a prison camp on foot. Many of the prisoners were killed out of hand, including anyone who dared to ask for water  …     and anyone who collapsed from dehydration. POWs reported Japanese soldiers taking away their meager supply of water and feeding it to horses while they watched. Starving men were tortured with false offers of food. Prisoners who accepted gifts of food from civilians along the route were murdered.  Some were murdered merely for possessing Japanese items, including currency. They were killed by beheading and run through with bayonets, as well as gunshots. Bayonet victims died from orgies of frenzied stabbing, not clean and swift impalement. Some of the captives were reportedly driven insane by exposure to the sun.  They were also crammed into   pens were malaria, dengue fever, dysentery, and other diseases ran wild. It has been estimated that between 5, 000 and 11, 000 of Japan’s prisoners were killed during the Bataan Death March. That wasn’t the only death march the Empire perpetrated, either. The prisoners of Sandakan were subjected to multiple forced marches, once the Japanese lost interest in using them as slave labor. By the time they were finished, only six of the original 2, 390 prisoners were still alive. One of the Japanese torture methods recounted by survivors of Sandakan involved pouring water down a prisoner’s throat until his stomach became distended, and then kicking him in the stomach.  About half of Japan’s captives in the Pacific died before the end of the war. Brave men who survived the experience spent the rest of their lives refusing to talk about what they went through.  The Rape of Nanking, Citizen of the World Barack Obama doesn’t much care for the idea of “American exceptionalism,” so he might want to consider the atrocities Imperial Japan perpetrated against the people of other countries, too. In Bataan and other POW atrocities, for example, the Japanese were even more brutal toward Filipinos than Americans. China, of course, still remembers the Rape of Nanking. That was a literal rape, involving up to 80, 000 sexual assaults. The   city of Nanking, capital of Nationalist China at the time, was laid waste. Japanese conquerors murdered men, women, and children by the thousands, leaving bodies piled up along the streets. The Yangtze River turned red from all the blood. The death toll ran into the hundreds of thousands, leaving some modern observers to speak of genocide. The exact body count remains a matter of political dispute between Japan and China to this day. The figure generally accepted at   trials was over 200, 000, but some think the total number is closer to 400, 000. Imperial Japan approached its Chinese foes with the same strategy ISIS uses against its enemies today: maximum carnage and savagery, to terrorize the foe into submission. They used some of the exact same methods ISIS does, including burning captives alive, beheading them, and burying them alive in slaughter pits. Also like ISIS, the Japanese occupiers were fond of taking triumphant photos of their atrocities, which is the only reason we know about many of them. They didn’t have Twitter or YouTube, of course, but Chinese working in photo shops smuggled out copies of photographs the Japanese government later attempted to destroy.  International visitors to Nanking tried to establish a safe zone for Chinese civilians, but it didn’t hold the Japanese at bay for long. One important chronicle of the occupation was the diary of an American woman named Minnie Vautrin, who wrote of girls as young as 12 being dragged away for rape, and piles of corpses burned to erase evidence of Japan’s crimes. Vautrin was one of the last victims of the Rape of Nanking. She killed herself in 1941. Also horrified by what he saw was the man who wound up leading the unsuccessful effort to maintain an international safe zone in Nanking, John Rabe. He was the head of the local Nazi Party. Unsurprisingly, China’s   media is very upset that Barack Obama didn’t mention Nanking, or other Japanese offenses against China, during his Hiroshima speech. “The death of Japanese civilians in the Hiroshima atomic bomb attack deserves global sympathy, but the tragedy was of Japan’s own making. Its then militarist government turned the city into the site of military headquarters, arsenals and camps and a vital part of its war machine that killed tens of millions in other countries,” writes Xinhua in a fiery editorial. The Empire’s war on women was not limited to Nanking. For decades afterward, Japan has dealt with the legacy of the “comfort women,” girls forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese Army. Only last year, Japan and South Korea reached an agreement for roughly $8 million dollars in reparations to South Korean victims. Murdering Doctors and Nurses, Working in a hospital afforded no protection from Imperial Japanese forces. When 65 Australian Army nurses tried to escape from Singapore ahead of Japanese occupation, Japanese planes blew their overloaded boat out of the water, then strafed the survivors. Many of those who made it ashore to Bangka Island were shot or bayoneted by Japanese troops, despite the nurses showing their Red Cross armbands when they surrendered. The nurses had an opportunity to escape, but matron Irene Drummond would have none of it, because they had injured men to take care of. “Girls, we have run away from the wounded once,” she declared. “We are not going to do it again. ” Drummond’s last words, as she and 21 of her nurses were marched into the surf on Bangka Island for a   massacre by Japanese soldiers, were: “Chin up, girls! I’m proud of you all, and I love you all. ”  We know this because one of the nurses, the Vivian “Bully” Bullwinkel, survived her gunshot wound and testified against the murderers at their   trial. She was captured by the Japanese again after she walked off the beach, and realized they might slaughter all of their prisoners if they knew she was eyewitness to such a war crime, so she hid her bullet wound from her captors and quietly treated it herself  …     even though she had been shot in the back. At St. Stephen’s College in Hong Kong, which was serving as a relief hospital, Japanese troops murdered doctors, slaughtered their injured patients, and raped the nurses. The massacre at St. Stephen’s began on Christmas Day. Imperial Japan deliberately attacked hospital ships on several documented occasions, including the Manunda and Centaur of Australia. Japan did not formally admit to sinking the Centaur until 1979. Cannibalism and Medical Experiments, Imperial Japan was infamous for torturing and killing its prisoners, in defiance of all international laws. Sometimes execution was the   scenario for its prisoners. In the 1990s, documents were uncovered that described widespread cannibalism by Japanese troops. The Japanese academic who collected these papers, Toshiyuki Tanaka, said the cannibalism was not primarily due to a shortage of food, but “to consolidate the group feeling of the troops. ” Tanaka documented at least 100 cases of cannibalism against Australian and Indian soldiers, and forced laborers in New Guinea, plus evidence of more such atrocities in the Philippines. “A Pakistani, who was captured when Japan overran Singapore and taken to New Guinea, testified that in his area Japanese soldiers killed and ate one prisoner a day for ‘about 100’ days. The corporal said he saw flesh being cut from prisoners who were still alive,” reported the UK Telegraph in 1992. A later Telegraph article cites research that suggests that four of the eight American airmen captured after bombing raids on Chichi Jima island, south of Tokyo, were cannibalized after all eight were tortured and executed with swords, bayonets, and bamboo stakes. A ninth pilot who had to bail out of his plane during the raids managed to evade capture by the Japanese. His name was Lt. George Bush. Imperial Japan also conducted horrifying medical experiments on its prisoners, including the removal of their organs while they were still alive, without anesthesia. Some of these crimes were concealed with false claims by the Japanese government that American test subjects had been transferred to Hiroshima as POWs and vaporized in the atomic bomb blast. The   Imperial Army Unit 731 conducted medical experiments on thousands of POWs and civilians, including chemical and biological warfare research. These weren’t just laboratory experiments  —   they   “plague bombs” on Chinese towns. Plans were made to deploy these biological weapons against American cities with balloons and kamikaze attacks. Imperial Japan was very interested in developing and using weapons of mass destruction. A veteran of Unit 731 recounted the story of vivisecting a live Chinese prisoner in 1995, as recounted by the New York Times:  The fellow knew that it was over for him, and so he didn’t struggle when they led him into the room and tied him down. But when I picked up the scalpel, that’s when he began screaming.  I cut him open from the chest to the stomach, and he screamed terribly, and his face was all twisted in agony. He made this unimaginable sound, he was screaming so horribly. But then finally he stopped. This was all in a day’s work for the surgeons, but it really left an impression on me because it was my first time. Unit 731’s headquarters was straight out of a horror movie, with pieces of POW displayed in jars labeled by their nationality.  Conclusion, This list could be ten times as long as it is. Apologies to all those who lost family to Imperial Japanese atrocities that were not listed individually. The purpose of this list is not to keep score on the horrors of war. It is the business of madmen to debate whether dying from radiation exposure is “better” than dying in a firebomb attack, or live burial alongside a few dozen friends and family members.  This is also not an assault on Japanese citizens of today. Japan is a good friend of the United States now, and that is the happiest ending one could ask from a story this horrible. The Empire of Japan is gone. It had to go. People who think like Barack Obama have no idea how to fight a war like that. God help us all if they are in power when the next such war is forced upon us. This is, rather, an effort to help understand what was destroyed by the right, proper, and absolutely necessary bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is the horror that would have claimed countless more victims if Japan had not been forced to surrender. It is very easy for callow politicians in 2016 to say that more Americans, and more Japanese, should have died in battle during a conventional invasion of Japan, to spare it the fury of the atomic bomb. Not many people felt that way at the time, especially if they were aware of the atrocities chronicled here. Barack Obama treats the bombing of Hiroshima as a unique “evil. ” No, sir. It was the end of an evil.  Some brave men  —   tragically, some good men  —   died fighting for Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany. Memorial Day is about showing our gratitude and respect to the heroes who had no choice but to kill them, including the crew of the Enola Gay. They saved a hell of a lot of lives, and souls, on that terrible day."

A fourth suspect was charged Saturday with terrorist murder and identified by the federal prosecutor’s office only as Faycal C. A fifth man remains on the run. Here are brief profiles of the five: Faycal C, or Faycal Cheffou,   Faycal C, believed to be the “man in a hat” pictured in CCTV footage alongside the two airport bombers, but whose device did not go off, is the first person to face terrorist offences over the bloodiest attacks ever to strike the symbolic capital of Europe. Sources close to the inquiry told AFP he was Faycal Cheffou, an independent journalist who was accused by the Brussels mayor last year of trying to recruit jihadists among refugees and who can be seen on YouTube in 2014 demanding the authorities respect the rights of  . He was arrested late Thursday close to the federal prosecutor’s office with two others when tailed by police, and “has been charged with taking part in a terrorist group, terrorist murder and attempted terrorist murder. ” Police searched his home but found no explosives or weapons. Najim Laachraoui,   Najim Laachraoui, 24, has been identified as one of the two airport suicide bombers and is believed to have been the   for November’s attacks in Paris. He is described as having been a good student with a good disciplinary record, and friends and family remember an   youngster who liked playing frisbee and football. In 2012 he enrolled for a first year   engineering course at Brussels Free University (ULB) but failed to sign up for a second year. He was a practising Muslim, whose radicalisation shocked the family. When he told them in 2013 he was heading to Syria they contacted the police. He resurfaced in September, two months before the Paris attacks, when he was stopped by police on the   border. He was travelling with Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam and using the false identity of Soufiane Kayal. Investigators have found traces of Laachraoui’s DNA on explosives used in the Paris gun and suicide bomb assaults, as well as at hideouts and a suspected bomb factory in the Schaarbeek district of Brussels. Ibrahim El Bakraoui, The    was one of the two airport suicide bombers and is the brother of Khalid, who blew himself up on a train at Maalbeek metro station in the Belgian capital.   Long before, the two lived the lives of   Brussels hoodlums, piling up convictions for carjackings, robberies and   with police.   Ibrahim was handed a   sentence in 2010 after a gunfight with police. He took part in a bungled robbery at a Western Union office in which an officer was shot and wounded. After his release from prison in 2014 he went to join the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria or Iraq. Turkey said it had detained Ibrahim in June last year as a “foreign terrorist fighter” and then deported him to the Netherlands, but that Belgium failed to confirm his links to terrorism. Ibrahim, who is seen on the CCTV footage with two others pushing airport trolleys with their   bags, left a confused and scared message on an abandoned computer, according to the Belgian federal prosecutor. “Hunted everywhere  …     no longer safe,” Ibrahim said in the message. “I don’t know what to do. ” Khalid El Bakraoui,   His younger brother Khalid, 27, who blew himself up at Maalbeek station just a short walk from the main EU institutions, was a convicted carjacker, receiving a   sentence in 2011. On an Interpol “terrorism” list, Khalid is suspected of having rented a flat under a false identity in the Forest district of Brussels that was raided by police on March 15. It was as a hideout months earlier for the Paris team and he was thought to have rented other properties used to prepare the Paris attacks, including one in the southern Belgian city of Charleroi from where ringleader Abdelhamid Abaaoud set off to spearhead the assault.

Told Congress - Breitbart,Breitbart,Caroline May,2016-06-21,2016.0,6.0,,"The Obama Administration “grossly misrepresented” the number of crimes the criminal aliens it released from custody in FY 2014 subsequently committed by nearly tenfold, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) charges. [According to FAIR, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) records the Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI) obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FIOA) request on FAIR’s behalf reveal that the 30, 558 criminal aliens ICE released in FY 2014 committed 13, 288 additional crimes.  The number of subsequent convictions contained in FIOA documents is far higher than the 1, 423 additional offenses ICE reported to the House Judiciary Committee last July. The criminal aliens released in FY 2014 who went on to commit those additional crimes had convictions for offenses like homicide, kidnapping, assault, sexual assault, and drunk driving. The new crimes, according to ICE’s report to Congress, included vehicular homicide, domestic violence, sexual assault, DUI, burglary and assault. “Rather than end dangerous   policies that have put a total of 85, 000 deportable criminal aliens back onto the streets in the last three years, ICE tried to hide them by providing grossly inaccurate information to Congress and the American people,” Dan Stein, the president of FAIR, said in statement.

[The proposed law would allow harsher punishment for those found guilty of such attacks.  According to the Los Angeles Times, Obernolte cites increased attacks nationwide on law enforcement this year  —   62 up to the present moment, a marked increase over the 38 shot to death last year  —   as justification for his bill. Eight officers were killed in July during just two incidents  —   the attack on Dallas Police and the attack in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Both attacks occurred in July. Obernolte said: Our police officers put their lives on the line every day and it’s deeply disturbing when they are intentionally targeted because of their chosen profession. This law will send a message to criminals targeting law enforcement officers that their reprehensible behavior will not be tolerated. The ACLU is pushing back against Obernolte’s legislation, voicing concern that granting adding police officers “hate crime” protection “could dilute the original intention of hate crime measures. ” Kevin Baker, legislative director with the ACLU of California’s Center for Advocacy and Policy, said: Our hate crime statute is simply not the proper home for these offenses. Peace officer status is an employment category not analogous to the personal characteristics included in our hate crime statute, including disability, gender, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation.

[Clooney and his wife Amal will be hosting a pair of fundraisers for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton next month.  Ahead of the fundraisers  —   and a contest in which a raffle winner will meet Clinton at the Clooney’s California home  —   the actor is ramping up his criticism of GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, whom he previously described as a “xenophobic fascist. ” In a letter being sent out to supporters of Clinton’s White House bid by her campaign, Clooney describes Clinton as a “voice of tolerance and experience” and attempts to besmirch Trump as a racist Islamophobe who wants to commit “war crimes. ” While Clooney does not use Trump’s name in the letter, he does share some choice words for the New York billionaire and anyone who agrees with him on immigration and national security. “If you listen to the loudest voices out there today, you’d think we’re a country that hates Mexicans, hates Muslims, and thinks that committing war crimes is the best way to make America great again,” Clooney writes in the letter, which was obtained by Variety. “The truth is that the only thing that would prevent America from being great would be to empower these voices. ” Clooney adds:   …     In all of this clutter, there’s been one consistent voice. A voice of tolerance and experience, from a candidate who’s spent a lifetime fighting for the rights of the less fortunate. A candidate who knows firsthand the complexity of our international relationships.   …     That candidate is Hillary Clinton.   …     As this primary process continues, Hillary could soon have an insurmountable delegate lead and with that, the Democratic nomination,” Clooney declares. “That would then make her the only   in the room.

25462,25467,44221,"Gun Crime Convictions Down, but Gun Control Rhetoric Up",Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2016-01-01,2016.0,1.0,,"Gun crime convictions are down more than 33 percent compared to a decade ago, but the Obama administration’s gun control push has risen sharply. [In fact, Politico reports that next week, Obama is expected to announce executive gun control to broaden background checks and put new regulations on licensed gun sellers.  According to The Washington Times, gun crime convictions “[peaked] at 9, 206 a decade ago” —  under George W. Bush —  but fell “to 6, 002 in fiscal year 2015. ” And one reason for the lower number of convictions is that prosecutors “are simply bringing fewer cases” under Obama. For example, “Of the two most common federal gun offenses —  illegally selling a firearm or using one in connection with another crime —  the number of cases dropped from 11, 067 in 2004 to 8, 078 in 2014. ” According to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) Reports, annual gun crime convictions under Obama have never matched the number of convictions secured under Bush in 2008 —  and 2008 was not even Bush’s best year for securing convictions. The number of convictions in 2008 topped 8, 000. Obama has only had two years with over 7, 000 convictions, and the rest of his annual numbers were in the 6, 000 range. Yet the gun control push is relentless. In addition to the highly anticipated executive gun control —  coming next week —  Obama has been calling on Congress to expand background checks, add the   list to current gun controls, and ban the sale of “assault weapons,” which Obama calls “weapons of war. ” Follow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

25814,25819,44573,Hate Crime Prosecutions Fall Despite Supposed ’Surge’ After Brexit,Breitbart,Nick Hallett,2016-09-05,2016.0,9.0,,"Hate crime prosecutions fell by almost 10 per cent in England and Wales last year despite a rise in the number of reported incidents. [Figures from a Freedom of Information request hate crime reports increased by 20 per cent  —   from 50, 288 in   to 60, 255 in   the BBC reports.  However, data from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) hate crime report showed the number of cases referred to prosecutors decreased from 14, 376 in   to 12, 997 in    —   a drop of 9. 6 per cent. The British media focused heavily on an alleged increase in hate crime in the make of June’s Brexit vote, however Breitbart London exposed how   campaigners were using social media to inflate the figures. The “Worrying Signs” Facebook page encouraged members to “spread some awareness” of perceived incidents after the referendum, encouraging them to “share information, post pictures, add screen grabs (etc.) of any worrying signs or incidents of racism   xenophobia you’ve come across since the UK EU referendum results”. The page, which swelled to almost 12, 000 members just a week after the vote, then told supporters to report incidents to the police. Breitbart London reported how it takes just minutes to report an alleged hate incident online, raising questions over whether the supposed surge in reports was politically motivated. All posts on the page were also kept public, thus allowing alleged incidents to go viral in the media and creating a narrative of rising hate. A police statement later clarified that while reported hate crimes had risen via an online form, there was no evidence of a genuine increase in incidents. Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton said that while online reported incidents had risen 57 per cent, the figure “should not be read as a national increase in hate crime of 57% but an increase in reporting through one mechanism. ”"
25917,25923,44677,Police Department Survey: Violent Crime Up in Major Cities - Breitbart,Breitbart,Caroline May,2016-07-26,2016.0,7.0,,"The number of homicides committed in major cities during the first half of this year is up by more than 15 percent, and overall violent crime is up more than two percent compared to the first half of 2015, according to data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA). [A midyear comparison of violent crime in major cities between 2015 and 2016, compiled via a survey of police departments, reveals increases in several categories of violent crimes.  According to the MCCA survey, the police departments of major cities reported a total of 2, 308 homicides during the first half of 2016 compared to 2, 001 during the first half of 2015. Additionally aggravated assaults increased from 68, 990 in the first half of 2015 to 70, 809 so far this year,   shootings grew from 6, 362 to 6, 965 this year to date, and robberies have also increased from 46, 182 during the first half of 2015 to 47, 294 this year. Rape was the one category of the five that saw a slight decrease from 10, 799 last year to 10, 606 so far in 2016. The data only includes major cities that responded to the MCCA’s survey. For example, while New York City usually responds to MCCA’s data requests it has yet to do so for this survey and is therefore not included in the results.   cities were however represented in the survey, including Orlando, FL where a terrorist recently killed 49 people. “The biggest take away is that even though there is an increase in several violent crimes a few cities (Chicago, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas, LA County, Louisville, San Antonio) account for much of the overall increase,” Darrel Stephens, the executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association explained in an email to Breitbart News, “Of course the tragic mass shooting in Orlando accounts for 49 of the homicides. Of the 51 major cities’ police departments’ 29 reported increases in the number of homicides, including: Arlington PD, Atlanta PD, Aurora PD, Austin PD, Baltimore County PD, Boston PD, Chicago PD, Dallas PD, Forth Worth PD, Jacksonville Sheriff’s Dept. Las Vegas Metropolitan PD, Long Beach PD, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Dept. Los Angeles PD, Louisville Metro PD, Nashville PD, Newark PD, Oklahoma City PD, Orlando PD, Philadelphia PD, Phoenix PD, Pittsburgh PD, Prince George’s County PD, San Antonio PD, San Diego PD, San Jose PD, Seattle PD, Tulsa PD, Washington DC (Metro PD). As Stephens noted, several cities experienced substantial increases in violent crime. In Chicago, for example, homicides grew from 211 in the first half of 2015 to 316 so far this year. Rape in Chicago was also up (677 compared to 643 last year) as was robbery (5, 176 compared to 4, 050 last year) aggravated assault (2, 751 compared to 2, 298 last year) and   shootings (1, 321 compared to 875 last year). Phoenix, Las Vegas, Dallas, Los Angeles County, Louisville, and San Antonio, as Stephens indicated, also saw markedly higher violent crime levels.   homicides were reported in Phoenix during the first half of this year, 26 more than were reported during the first half of 2015. Las Vegas reported 90 homicides so far this year, 34 more than last year. Dallas has seen an increase of 14 more homicides over last year, reaching 83. Los Angeles County reported 25 more homicides over last year with a total so far this year of 110. Louisville and San Antonio both reported 19 more homicides than the first half of 2015."

[“Help is coming,” Trump told the angel families, assuring them that “their loved ones will not have died in vain. ”  At a Saturday luncheon hosted by the Remembrance Project, a group that represents the American victims of illegal alien crime, Trump honored the “stolen American lives” and pledged to “advocate for justice on behalf of all American victims. ” Trump explained that contrary to the corporate media’s narrative, it is these American victims who have been “truly forced into the shadows. ” Trump said: I’m honored to be here today and to shine a national spotlight on a group of victims who have been forced, and I mean truly forced into the shadows. Your stories are not featured in the news. You don’t have demonstrators taking to the streets on your behalf. You have no special interests taking up your cause. And the politicians ignore your cries for help. But I never will. I will never  …     Your cause and your stories are ignored by our political establishment because they are determined to keep our borders open at any cost. To them your presence is just too inconvenient. That’s all it is, it’s an inconvenience. “Help is coming. I’ll tell you that, help is coming,” Trump declared. “On November 8th, we’re going to win the White House [loud applause]. And we are going to deliver justice for every American family and every single American victim  …     Together we will save American lives and prevent the next thousand American parents from suffering the same fate of the people in this room today. Their loved ones will not have died in vain. ” Trump noted that “there are so many people,” who have been victimized by open borders. “The devastation is unbelievable. ” “This has to end. It will end. if I become president, I promise you it will end,” Trump pledged. “Not one more American life should be given up in the name of open borders. ” “Whether its drug, terrorism, or violent crime our government is utterly failing in its core mission to defend and protect the people of this country,” Trump said, adding: The most fundamental duty of government is to protect American lives  …     Anyone who fails to understand this is not fit to hold public office (loud applause). Every day our border remains open, innocent Americans are needlessly victimized and killed  …     Every day we fail to enforce our laws  …     is a day when a loving parent is at risk of losing their child. And it’s happening every single day. All across this country, dining room tables have an empty seat at the family table because our government abandoned its duty and failed to enforce our basic laws. “What do you tell the mother who just buried her daughter because someone was released at the border who should have been sent home?” Trump asked. “What do you tell the young boy who will grow up without a dad because a criminal was deported five times, but was allowed to keep coming back, and coming back, and coming back into our country doing tremendous harm?” “There are a lot of numbers in the immigration debate,” Trump added. “Let me give you the most important number of all. That most important number of all is the number of American lives that is acceptable to lose in the name of illegal immigration. Let me tell you what that number is: zero. Zero. Our nation should not accept one lost American life because our country failed to enforce its laws. ” Trump, who described these forgotten American families as “some of the bravest people I know,” said that advocating on behalf of their interests has “become a personal passion” of his: I’ve met many incredible people during the course of this campaign but nothing has moved me more deeply than the time I’ve spent with the families of the Remembrance Project  …     I have known many of you for a long time now. I’m still here, and you’re still here —  still fighting  …     The strength and the courage that you’ve shown in your very often lonely fight for justice —  we’ll get there —  you are the heroes. You are. And your actions will help us to save the next thousand American citizens from losing their brothers and sisters and sons and daughters and parents. Trump met with the families privately backstage for an hour prior to the luncheon. “These are truly wounded families. And sadly, they’ll never be the same. ” Trump told the crowd, noting that while they were backstage, “I asked them if it gets better with time  …     They said it doesn’t, and that sometimes it gets worse with time. ” Trump explained that these “unbelievably strong and brave people” are “representing thousands and thousands” of others who have suffered similar losses as a result our open borders. Trump concluded by, once again, reaffirming his commitment to fight on their behalf and on behalf of the American people. “We will fight, and we will win, and again I say your loved ones will not have died in vain. ” Maria Espinoza, founder of the Remembrance Project, thanked Trump for the compassion he has shown to “America’s most forgotten families. ” Espinoza said, “On June 16th 2015, most Americans probably don’t remember that day, but here our families do. We remember that day because that is the day Donald Trump announced his run for President of the United States. There is only one candidate who spoke the truth. There is only one candidate who reached out to our stolen lives families, America’s most forgotten families. There is only one candidate who embraced and took in his arms the mothers whose children were killed, innocent victims. And for over 15 months Mr. Trump has traveled all across the United States and met with our families and listened to their stories. ”"

26441,26447,45202,Gun Controllers Claim Obama’s Executive Gun Controls Will Reduce California Crime,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,2016-01-07,2016.0,1.0,,"California gun controllers reacted to President Obama’s executive gun control by claiming the new regulations and expanded laws will help California fight crime. [The problem with this claim is that California’s gun control already exceeds the changes put forth by Obama.  According to the Los Angeles Daily News, gun controllers believe Obama’s rules will impact guns in surrounding states, thereby lowering California’s crime rate. Ari Freilich of The San   Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence said: States with weak gun laws and no (universal) background check requirement are a major source of crime guns here in California. Though California law regulates the importation of firearms from out of state, unscrupulous individuals can too easily obtain firearms in neighboring states without a background check and bring those firearms into California. What Freilich overlooked is that ATF figures show that only roughly 11 percent of the guns used in crime in 2014 were from Arizona, Nevada, or Texas. The Daily News reports that 21, 267 guns were recovered in 2014, only 2, 452 of which were from Arizona, Nevada, or Texas. That means 18, 815 of the guns were acquired under California’s highly restrictive gun control system. For this reason, California Rifle and Pistol Association’s Chuck Michel says Obama’s executive gun controls are not going to impact crime in California. Rather, the new controls will simply serve to “harass” law abiding citizens who now have more hoops to jump through before acquiring the guns they need for   in other states. Michel said, “It’s not going to stop a criminal from getting [a gun] and it sure as hell isn’t going to stop a terrorist from getting one. They’ll steal it or smuggle it in from Mexico or get someone else to buy it for them. ” Ironically, the San Bernardino attackers used the very method Michel outlines. Syed Farook passed background checks to acquire the handguns used in the attack, while he and Tashfeen Malik availed themselves of   that had been legally purchased by someone else who passed a background check.

26701,26707,45462,Netflix’s ’Making a Murderer’ Is a Moral Crime Against Teresa Halbach’s Family - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Nolte,2016-01-19,2016.0,1.0,,"Like many over the holidays, I was enthralled by the Netflix   true crime documentary series “Making a Murderer. ” Over just two days, I gobbled the whole thing up and repeatedly tweeted out praise for what is objectively a remarkable achievement. Over the course of 10 years, documentarians Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos whittled down hundreds of hours of footage into a fraction of that to present the case of Steven Avery, a working class Wisconsin man convicted of a brutal murder just two years after serving 18 years for a rape he didn’t commit.  Also convicted was Brendan Dassey, Avery’s   16   nephew, who repeatedly confessed and recanted his role in aiding his uncle in the brutal rape, torture, murder, and mutilation (the corpse was burned in a fire pit) of the victim, 25   Autotrader photographer Teresa Halbach. Both received life sentences without any chance of parole. What surprised me is that afterwards I appeared to be the only person who was still sure Avery and Dassey were guilty. That doesn’t mean that the Manitowoc Country justice system covered itself in all kinds of glory. It did not. There are a number of legitimate questions that add up to an   prosecution and investigation, up to and including the planting of evidence. This is known as “framing a guilty man,” and regardless of one’s intent, it is not okay.  Nevertheless, the forensic and circumstantial case presented against Avery left no room in my mind for reasonable doubt of his guilt. Avery was the last person to see Teresa Halbach alive. Her charred  remains were found in his fire pit. His hand was freshly cut, and his blood found in her vehicle. Her vehicle was found hidden on his property. Avery and Dassey both admitted to using the burn pit the afternoon and evening of her murder. Who else could have possibly murdered this young woman? The turning point for me came with the blood evidence. Avery’s extremely able defense attorneys (paid for by the suit Avery filed against the state for his wrongful conviction) suggested the blood had been planted by police. Police had in their possession a vial of Avery’s blood. However, a preservative is added to blood samples and after conducting a test, no less than the F. B. I. concluded there was no preservative in the blood taken from the vehicle. Unless you want to believe the same F. B. I. that loves to embarrass locals was in on the conspiracy, that is forensic evidence no defense attorney can talk around. On the issue of the nephew, if you believe Avery is guilty, you have to believe Dassey is guilty and that they burned the body together. I’m also not as horrified as others over the way in which the police got Dassey to confess. Sure, they pushed him but he was never threatened. The investigating officers never even raised their voices (that I recall). And even if you have a 70 IQ, you don’t confess to something you didn’t do, much less rape and murder.  At the risk of digressing too much, let me further explain my belief in Avery and Dassey’s  guilt: When it comes to America’s criminal justice system, I am a small “l” liberal, a true believer in an adversarial process that places all of the burden on the State a true believer in the rights of the accused and an advocate for the checks and balances of our appeals process, especially when it comes to the death penalty. When you give the State the power to strip an individual of his freedom or life, that power must be continually tested, prodded, and challenged. At the same time, I am not a cynic. This is primarily because of my faith in American juries. I am a firm believer in the common sense and decency of the everyday American, the people plucked from their lives and handed the awesome responsibility of being the ultimate deciders in a criminal case. Who better? People who work within the system can be easily corrupted. A “professional jury” could easily be corrupted. Our jury process is how we avoid Star Chambers. As it stands now,  the only responsibility and obligation a juror has is making a decision he or she can live with. In short, while I naively believed the “Making a Murderer” filmmakers had told the full truth, in the end I sided with the evidence and those 12 everyday people who came together in unison to convict. It is also no small thing that Avery could afford   attorneys.  This was the opposite of a “poor man” against the criminal justice system. But back to our story  …     As most of you know, “Making a Murderer” quickly became something of a phenomenon, and as a result, a thousand editorials were launched proclaiming the innocence of the accused and a demand for a retrial.  Except for a few tweets, I remained silent through all of this. While I disagree on the point of the duo’s guilt, I did agree that they deserve a retrial. Now, however, and to my great disappointment, the worm has turned with the revelation of the full case against Avery and Dassey. There is just no question that this documentary is pure propaganda  —   both misleading and corrupted. What Ricciardi and Demos chose not to tell the viewers is moral malpractice, and now that the full truth is coming out, a   backlash is in full force. This is what the documentarians did not want us to know: The issue of the cellphone is especially problematic. The series implies that whoever accessed Teresa Halbach’s phone on the day she died (which both Halbach’s brother and her   admit to doing) might have been involved in her murder. But anyone with physical access to Halbach’s phone would have also been able to access her voice mail. Is that why this piece of evidence was left out? What’s more, at the time of Halbach’s disappearance, Steven Avery was being investigated for the alleged 2004 sexual assault of a teenage female relative, who claimed that Avery threatened to “kill her family” if she told anyone about it. Worse, Dassey alleged in a phone call to his mother that in the past Avery had touched him in places that made him “uncomfortable. ” Stachowski claims that Avery beat her repeatedly, and Penny Beerntsen, who mistakenly identified Avery as her attacker in the 1985 rape, says that Avery called her up shortly after his exoneration, asking for money to “buy a house. ” Crucial Reading: David Harsanyi’s “Steven Avery is Guilty as Hell” and  The New Yorker’s “How ‘Making a Murderer’ Went Wrong. ” When you are producing a     “time constraint” is not a valid excuse for leaving out all of this vitally important and relevant information. Moreover, Ricciardi and Demos cannot even argue that they left out Avery’s alleged assault against his own relative for fear the sensationalist nature of the charges would prejudice viewers against Avery. The filmmakers had no problem reporting sexual harassment charges leveled at Avery’s prosecutor, which were irrelevant to Avery’s prosecution.  Because I have always found fact much more intriguing and compelling than fiction, for decades I’ve been a true crime addict. As long as the presentation isn’t meant to titillate or exploit, whether it is documentaries, books, or a brilliant television series like “Forensic Files,” these dual examinations of the human condition and the American judicial system endlessly fascinate, especially when they serve as an invaluable court of last resort. “Making of a Murderer” does not belong in this genre. As   and addicting as “Making a Murderer” is, it is itself a moral crime, a piece of manipulative propaganda. And we the viewers are merely collateral damage in this unforgivable injustice perpetrated directly against the family of Teresa Halbach.   Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC                "

The protesters were focused on Clinton’s 1990s crime legislative, which they argued has unfairly incarcerated black Americans at a higher level. O’Reilly, however, argued that blacks were committing more crime, which make that ethnic groups incarceration rate than any other ethnic group. “Now the race question,” O’Reilly said. “Again, according to FBI data, from 1976 to 1995, black Americans were identified by police as committing more than half of the homicides in the USA.   make up 13 percent of the population. In addition, a national crime victims survey reported that blacks committed robberies at a rate of 60 percent. Again, the black community is just 13 percent of the population. So what’s the beef if black Americans are committing crimes    to other ethnic groups, why is there a racial component to their presence in prison? Why?” O’Reilly also dismissed the incarceration levels were higher because of drug use in the black community, noting that those convicted on   charges were found guilty of trafficking, not use. “Also, forget about the drug myth,” he added. “Right now in federal penitentiaries 99. 5 percent of   inmates are traffickers, not users  —   99. 5 percent. So the question becomes, why is the Democratic Party caving into propaganda put out by radical groups like Black Lives Matter? It is clear that tough sentencing reform spearheaded by both parties in the 90s and signed by Bill Clinton saved perhaps millions of American lives. Yet the entire criminal justice system is now being branded as racist and oppressive. Disgraceful. ” Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

[The official GoToplessDay website reported that August 28 was selected as the day for women to bare their breasts because it falls at the Sunday closest to Women’s Equality Day, Aug 26. Moreover, the site states, “[i]t is only logical that GoTopless Day protests (or celebrations depending on the legal status of your city) would fall around Women’s Equality Day since the right to go topless for women is based on gender equality as their right to vote once was. ”  According to the Associated Press, a group of about 50 women and men walked topless through Venice Beach in Southern California, behind a giant, inflatable pink breast that had the phrase “equal topless rights” written on it.

He began writing books about his newfound spirituality involving extraterrestrials and cloning as the means of immortality, and toured the world founding the Raelian movement. The religion makes sensuality and feminism part of its core values.

27698,27704,46463,Police Warn ’Pokémon Go’ Players After Increase in Crime - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,2016-07-14,2016.0,7.0,,"Law enforcement agencies have released warnings and statements regarding augmented reality smartphone game Pokémon Go in an attempt to keep civilians safe. [From criminals using the game to lure, follow, and then rob unsuspecting victims to a    girl after she jumped a fence to play the game to trespassing reports as players look to find elusive Pokémon, Pokémon Go has caused a stir around the world, and police are trying to keep people from getting into trouble.  “The Goochland County Sheriff’s Office has been experiencing a rise in Trespassing and Suspicious Activity events recently due to the new Pokémon Go app,” announced the Goochland County Sheriff’s Office in a post to their Facebook page. This is a   type system that incorporates real world maps and digital gaming and is extremely popular. Deputies have located numerous individuals on business, church, and government properties at all hours of the night, when these places are closed to the public. The participants are using their phones to find the location of “Pokemons” in order to play the game. These actions are considered trespassing and put the individual and Deputies in a position of unnecessary risk. Please refrain from going onto property without proper permission or after appropriate times. Parents should encourage their children to avoid these actions for their own safety and enjoy the game responsibly. Thank you for your assistance in this matter. “Don’t catch  drive!” warned the Sarasota Police Department in a post on Twitter. Morning! Playing #PokemonGO? Don’t catch  drive! Wait, park  then #Pokemon Go. #GottaCatchEmAll but safely! #LESM pic. twitter.   —   SarasotaPD (@sarasotapd) July 11, 2016,  “As the Pokemon Go fever hits the Streets of San Francisco, I wanted to take a few minutes to remind   kids of some simple safety tips. So as you battle, train, and capture your Pokemon  —   just remember you’re still in the real world! Other law enforcement agencies throughout the world have already reported accidents, injuries, and string of robberies where suspects have set up fake ‘’” announced Captain Vaswani of the Bayview Police Station in San Francisco. Know your surroundings and pay attention to where you are   is around you. Slow car paralleling a person on foot, might be a sign it’s a   car. If you get the sense you are being followed or   for a robbery, head to a lighted area with people around. Watch where you are going, please don’t look down at your phone while crossing streets, getting off buses, or even while walking.  Obey traffic laws, please. Do not run into trees, meters, and things that are attached to the sidewalk they hurt. Do not drive or ride your bike   skateboard   hipster techie device while interacting with the app. Know where your kids are going when playing with the app, set limits on where they can go, so they don’t keep going trying to get that Pokemon. Tell your kids about   because the app may bring strangers together in real life at ‘pokestops’. Do not go onto private property, dark alleys, or areas that you usually would not go if you weren’t playing the game. Be Safe, Enjoy! Bangor Maine Police Department released a similar list of tips for players, and other police stations around the world have also joined in with the attempt to cut down on crime associated with the game. “Some Pokemon will be harder to collect than others, so please use common sense when throwing your pokeballs and enjoy the game,” posted Nottinghamshire Police on Facebook. “POLICE ARE NOW TARGETING: POKEMON,” announced Western Australia Police in a statement. WA Police have received numerous reports of Pokemon around the state. Rest assured  —   we’re gonna catch ’em all! Thanks to our counterparts at Queensland Police, here are a couple of tips to remember when collecting your Pokemon: 1. Communicate with your family, let them know where you plan on going and what time you will expect to be home. 2. ‘I was collecting Pokemon’ is not a legal defence against a charge of trespass, so be sure that you have permission to enter an area or building. 3. If you are using the app in a public place, stay alert to what is going on around you, and who is around you. “So you gotta catch ’em all  —   but don’t let your pursuit of virtual monsters get you into real strife,” warned New Zealand Police. We’d like players of the new Pokemon Go game to watch out for   hazards while using their phones to hunt Pokemon around our communities. Never use your phone while driving don’t step into the road without looking watch out for others  —   particularly if they’ve got their noses buried in their phones be aware of what’s happening around you and respect other people and their property. Stay safe and have fun! “Please just let natural selection happen, if people die while playing Pokemon then that’s life, the smart people come out on top!” commented one user on the post, gaining nearly 400 likes. Law enforcement agencies aren’t the only organizations who have had to release statements on the new augmented reality game either. The Holocaust Museum in Washington, D. C. was forced to release a statement asking people not to play the game there after it was revealed that the location was a “PokéStop”   along with the   Memorial and the Tomb of the Unknown Solider. “It’s not like we came here to play,” commented one woman who was seen playing the game at the museum. “But gotta catch ’em all. ” The Museum is currently attempting to get the area removed from the game.

I have been consistently speaking out about what I would do as president. And I think it’s important for people to recognize we have work to do. that there were a lot of people very scared and concerned about high crime back in the day. And now we’ve got to say, okay, we have to deal with the consequences. And one of the consequences is, in my view, over incarceration of people who should not have been in the criminal justice system. They have an addiction problem. they have committed a   offense, a nonviolence offense. So I want to convert people from the criminal justice system and from being incarcerated, and I want to do more if people are in corrections institutes to help them while they’re there, and i want to do more to help them when they get out,   into society. ” Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"

[Zoe   accused the town’s former mayor Guy Harkin of “misgendering” him repeatedly as part of a “personal attack” during a recent council meeting. Despite Cllr Harkin’s protestations that he had used the pronoun only as an accidental “slip” Greater Manchester Police are understood to be taking the allegation very seriously and treating it as a hate crime.

I expected better of a member of the Council. “For someone in the highest public forum of the town to feel transphobia was acceptable is shocking  —   It is not acceptable in Bolton  —   it shouldn’t be acceptable anywhere. ” He added: “Bolton has a problem with hate crime and for Cllr Harkin to engage in a personal attack against me in this matter only serves to legitimise transphobia in the eyes of the average bigot  —   which makes life harder for all LGBT people. ” In a video blog, the Conservative councillor added: “If I’m truthful, it hurt a lot. The guy had no reasons to ever suggest that I was male, he has never met me as a male. “I transitioned over 10 years ago and I have lived in Bolton for seven, going on eight years, he never met me before I transitioned. ” A campaigner for gay and transgender rights, Cllr   is a “hate crime ambassador” as part of a local   partnership. Confirming that he had reported the incident, Cllr   added: “The incident has been referred to Greater Manchester Police, and therefore is now out of my hands. As a hate crime ambassador, I always urge people to report hate crime when it occurs and I will continue to do so. ” Cllr Harkin, 69, insists that the use of ‘he’ to refer to Cllr   was accidental, however, and that it was not meant as a personal attack. Speaking to PinkNews, he said: “I was utterly unaware of this slip of the tongue until it was pointed out to me the day after the meeting. “I offered immediately to apologise as there is not a homophobic or any kind of phobic bone in my body. ” He added: “I am told I used ‘he’ instead of the appropriate ‘she’ twice, not repeatedly, or someone would surely have raised a point of order  —   and I would have apologised there and then. ” According to Cllr   Bolton Council is taking the allegation “seriously”."
28160,28167,46927,Lebanese Crime Clans Turn German Neighbourhoods Into No-Go Zones,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,2016-10-04,2016.0,10.0,,"While the Interior Ministry denies even the existence of   zones in Germany, officers report that Lebanese crime clans have made neighbourhoods across North   almost impossible to police. [At around 10 o’clock last Tuesday evening, police were called by concerned residents who alerted them to a mass brawl taking place outside a family restaurant in  .  Around 150 members of a Lebanese extended family and about two dozen bikers from a Hells Angels chapter, many of them also with a Lebanese background, were fighting one another with fists and broom handles. A significant deployment of police arrived at the scene after the bikers had eventually barricaded themselves in a nearby pub. More than 100 officers were involved in trying to settle the dispute between the two groups and a police helicopter monitored the situation from the air, all of which lasted until the early hours of the morning. Police report that the two groups have clashed before, beating each other with sticks and batons in another fight in August which required more than 100 police officers to bring the situation under control. The two factions claim their confrontation in August was about an argument over a parking lot but police believe the sides’ enmity is part of a bigger dispute between the two clans. “We do not know the true background. It is certainly not a biker war. Rather, we believe that this is a dispute between two clans, with the connections the biker group has,” Mettmann District police spokesman Ulrich Löhe said. The Cologne City Gazette notes that the confrontation would likely reignite the ongoing debate over the politically sensitive issue of   areas. Christian Democratic Union (CDU) interior expert Gregor Golland recently warned: “In North   (NRW) there are districts where clans have taken over the streets. After sunset, people and the authorities no longer dare leave the house. ” Asserting that areas of Germany are spiralling into lawlessness, Mr. Golland said: “We must be careful that these districts not slip completely. ” The Gazette reports that gangs and clans have taken control in neighbourhoods across the state’s metropolises including Duisburg, Gelsenkirchen, Essen, Cologne, Dortmund, Aachen, and Bochum. Violence against the police has risen as much as 50 per cent in many of these areas. In the Duisberg district of Marxloh last summer, a female police officer was heavily beaten by a mob from a Lebanese clan while recording a traffic accident. Her colleague was only able to restrain the attackers by drawing his handgun. In December last year, the police chief of Gelsenkirchen met with leaders of the Lebanese clans after months of violence. The men made clear that they weren’t wanting to negotiate peaceful coexistence with the force, telling him the police “will not win a war with the Lebanese, because we are too many. ” Members of the “Family Union” clan were unimpressed when the police chief announced the force planned to send more officers to “problem areas” in the town. According to an internal police report, the men said: “The country has no money to be using so many policemen to seek confrontation with the Lebanese. ” Germany’s Home Office completely denies the existence of   areas. Interior Minister Ralf Jäger said: “In North   there are no lawless areas. The NRW police drive their police cars down every street in every district. ” Interior expert Golland said he considers the Interior Minister’s statement “window dressing”. “People that address the problems are denounced as traitors”. Similarly, the Free Democratic Party’s interior expert Marc Lürbke told the Gazette: “Certain districts are now associated with significant risks for state officials. ” The staffing situation of NRW’s police force remains difficult. Responding to a question about how the number of cases of pickpocketing in Cologne is skyrocketing, the Interior Ministry’s department head said policing would need to be “thinned out” in rural areas. The result, Wolfgang Düren admitted, is that police can now only afford to give “a minimum level of protection for the population”. The police union in the state (GdP) is viewing the situation in   zones with concern. GdP board member Volker Husz said: “The problem districts have significantly worsened in recent years. “Officials are insulted and threatened while they record traffic accidents, ambulance workers are attacked. We cannot let [this behaviour] pass. ”"
28461,28469,47230,Sex Crimes Increase as Oktoberfest Has Lowest Attendance for 15 Years,Breitbart,Nick Hallett,2016-10-04,2016.0,10.0,,"The world’s biggest beer festival has recorded its lowest turnout for 15 years amid heightened security fears, while at the same time experiencing an increase in reported sex crimes. [The Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany had around 5. 6 million visitors this year, down 300, 000 since last year and the lowest number since just after the September 11th 2001 terror attacks, according to FAZ.  The drop in the number of attendees follows a series of attacks in the German state of Bavaria. In July,   student David Ali Sonboly went on a shooting spree in Munich, killing nine people at a shopping centre before turning the gun on himself. In the same week, an Afghan migrant attacked a train in Würzburg with an axe, injuring at least four people, and a failed asylum seeker blew himself up at a bar in the town of Ansbach, injuring 12 people and killing himself. However, despite an overall fall in crime at the festival, the number of reported sex crimes increased this year from 21 to 31. The group “Safer Wiesn for Girls and Woman” also said 215 women came to security checkpoints for help this year compared to 197 last year, of whom 18 reported suffering violence. A number of   public events have reported an increase in sexual assaults since the massive influx of migrants began entering Europe last year. The most notorious example was the New Year’s Eve attacks in the German city of Cologne, in which gangs of mainly North African migrants committed mass sexual assaults against women revellers. Police received over 1, 500 complaints of sexual assault, mugging, pickpocketing and even rape, although it took the local government six months to admit the majority of perpetrators were recently arrived migrants. Figures showed that 70 per cent of the suspects had been in Germany for less than a year, despite repeated denial by authorities."

Jeff Sessions is going after a top immigration official who earlier admitted the U. S. government has invited future terrorists into American communities, the Obama administration’s   “vetting process” aside. [“The fact is —  anybody that understands the challenge they face to do this vetting. You cannot vet people from Syria, because there’s no way, and we have no plans to send anybody into Syria to verify anything that they say,” Sessions told León Rodríguez during his testimony before a Senate panel.  “That’s the problem, fundamentally,” the Republican continued. “Are you not aware that I have written four letters to the Department, asking for information on how many refugees have been convicted of criminal and terrorist activities?” Rodríguez, who directs citizenship and immigration Services for the Department of Homeland Security, said he wasn’t. “I confess Chairman, I am not. I will certainly make sure to follow up on those correspondence —  ” “This is absolutely breathtaking,” Sessions cut in. “It is a total disrespect to this body, who is in charge of giving you money to run your business. We should quit giving you money if you don’t respond and you don’t know basic things. ” Sessions, who who chairs the Senate’s Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, listed the letters he sent to the Department of Homeland Security, along with one sent directly to the president demanding to know how many refugees were convicted on criminal or terrorism charges in the U. S. “So do you think we’re entitled to know this?” he asked. “I will —  of course you’re entitled to answers to your questions. I will follow up, sir,” Rodríguez said. “Well, to me, it indicates the determination to promote an agenda without listening to the American people, without listening to their elected representatives, and to downplay and to misrepresent, really, the danger that this program presents,” Sessions said. “And we’re not having terrorists from a lot of areas, but some areas we’re having terrorists that threaten this country in a whole lot of ways. ” Sessions added that he had sent the letters to Department of Homeland Security secretary Jeh Johnson, and would take it as an “absolute refusal” to respond to legitimate requests to Congress if no one in the department brought them to Johnson’s or Rodríguez’s attention. Rodríguez also tried to clarify “our operations are   not  . They’re not funded by the taxpayers. ” “So you’re not funded by the taxpayers. And so you don’t have any responsibility to the taxpayers?” the Alabama senator asked. “No, we have a responsibility to the taxpayers,” Rodríguez backtracked, “and the American people to do our job the right way. That’s not the point I was making. ” “You don’t get any fees that Congress hasn’t authorized, isn’t that true?” Sessions asked. “That’s certainly true,” Rodríguez admitted. Sessions’ office found in June that of the 580 people convicted of   offenses between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2014 —  which does not include the terrorist Muslims who carried the   attacks —  380 were   with 24 of those brought in as refugees. Adding to the Department of Homeland Security’s immigration scandals, an audit revealed over 1, 811 aliens from terrorist countries under final deportation orders were granted U. S. citizenship —  giving them the right to vote and gain security clearances —  with the Obama administration shutting down the program that uncovered the rampant fraud. Another Obama administration official refused to say how many Syrian refugees specifically the government plans to ship to American neighborhoods. The outgoing Obama administration wants to ship 110, 000 refugees altogether to the U. S. in fiscal year 2017, which begins October 1."
28760,28768,47529,"Corruption, Ties to Organized Crime Taint Mexican Border State Elections",Breitbart,Ildefonso Ortiz,2016-05-28,2016.0,5.0,,"MATAMOROS, Tamaulipas  —   As the Mexican border state of Tamaulipas prepares for a heated gubernatorial election, the country’s ruling party has tried and failed at shaking their image of corruption and their ties to drug cartels. [Next week, Mexican citizens will take to the polls for their general election where, for the first time in more than 80 years, the gubernatorial candidate from the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) is lagging behind in the polls and is not a sure winner.   The chief concern among  residents along the northern part of Tamaulipas deals with the lack of basic security conditions as drug cartels have managed to impose their version of rule of law in this city despite the many claims made by government officials otherwise.  “No no no, you can’t live like this,” Margarita Estrada said in Spanish, a Matamoros resident who has seen the once busy tourist destination turn into a virtual ghost town as American visitors shy away from the constant cartel violence. “This used to be full of stores, full of Americans who would come drink, have a good time and shop without any concerns. Now this area is dying. ” The promises of improving security conditions have been made by candidates from the PRI for a long time. In 2011, current governor Egidio Torre Cantu came into power as a fresh face making multiple campaign promises. Residents believed that Torre Cantu would use his government’s power to stop the raging cartel violence at the time and clear up the June 2010 murder of his brother Rodolfo Torre Cantu who was the original gubernatorial candidate until a team of Los Zetas gunmen executed him.  Instead of delivering on the promises and expectations of improved security, Tamaulipas residents saw a government indifference that became known as “no pasa nada” or nothing bad is happening. Then residents saw an unending amount of rhetoric about improving security conditions with no tangible results.  As time passed, residents began to make up their minds as to why the PRI government in Tamaulipas was not delivering results in the fight against drug cartels.  In 2013, the U. S. Department of Justice delivered a heavy blow to the credibility of the PRI when they publicly named former Tamaulipas governor Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba as a wanted fugitive. Court documents from the Southern District of Texas charged Yarrington with laundering cartel bribes from the Gulf, Los Zetas and the Beltran Leyva Cartels. Additional charges of drug conspiracy accused him of  helping drug cartels have access to Mexican shipping ports.  In 2015, the U. S. Department of Justice delivered another heavy blow to the PRI when they named a second former Tamaulipas governor as  a wanted fugitive. Eugenio Hernandez Flores is currently wanted in the Southern District of Texas on money laundering charges.  As time has passed, U. S. federal authorities have gone on to charge other officials with money laundering and seize assets from a large number of individuals from the PRI including former Matamoros Mayor Erick Silva Santos and various other former state officials or PRI operators.  The PRI’s dark history has played a huge role in taking away support from its current gubernatorial candidate, Baltazar Hinojosa, who had been the mayor of Matamoros from 2005 to 2007. The onslaught of cartel violence that has taken over the state, as well as the unending cases of public corruption and cartel connections, has driven many residents away from the PRI. The exodus of supporters led to Hinojosa making a unique announcement last week.  During a televised news conference, Hinojosa delivered a series of steps that he would take as governor promising to take a hard stand on crime and ending the government indifference commonly referred to as “no pasa nada” or nothing bad is happening.  “Let it be clear, do not be mistaken, the candidate in this race is me, me right here,” Hinojosa said in Spanish. “I am not Tomas (Yarrington) I am not Eugenio (Hernandez) I am not Egidio (Torre Cantu). ” News outlets in Mexico took the statements as Hinojosa’s efforts to distance himself from the PRI’s dark past and an attempt to make a fresh start. Despite the efforts, Hinojosa has surrounded himself with multiple PRI operators who have a long history with the party. Perhaps the most damaging figure to his effort of creating distance with the Party is former governor turned DOJ fugitive Hernandez. Leaked photographs and statements from businessmen in Tampico, Matamoros, and Reynosa point to Hernandez having town hall meetings with party insiders, where he openly campaigns for his “Amigo” Hinojosa.  It remains unclear as to why the Mexican government has been reluctant to arrest and extradite Yarrington and Hernandez, who has told reporters that he is not worried when he has been asked about being a wanted fugitive.   However, as Breitbart Texas previously reported, U. S. Congressman Filemon Vela has repeatedly called for the U. S. Department of State to put political pressure on Mexico to have the two fugitive governors extradited.

28800,28808,47570,Wave of Fake ’Hate Crimes’ Sweeps anti-Trump Social Media,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-11-13,2016.0,11.0,,"Fake reports of “hate crimes” committed by fans of   Donald Trump are sweeping the nation. Meanwhile, real crimes continue to be committed by   rioters in dozens of cities across America. [One fake “hate crime” involved a Muslim woman at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who claimed that she had her hijab torn off by two white males. Lafayette police now report that she “admitted that she fabricated the story. ”  Other incidents are being reported as “crimes” that are not crimes at all. CNN published a list of “hate crimes” on Saturday that includes an incident where a group of middle school students chanted “Build the wall!” in a cafeteria. That is not a “crime” it is juvenile behavior by boorish   and   . Another “crime” on CNN’s list comes from a university where “somebody chalked the words ‘Trump,’ ‘Build wall’ and ‘[Expletive deleted] your safe space’ in front of the library. That’s right: they used actual chalk. Other than that, there’s not much. Elizabeth Nolan Brown of Reason. com has posted a more extensive list of cases where police were unable to verify the allegations being made, including an alleged attack on a gay man in Santa Monica, California. Rep. Jared Huffman ( ) documented three men showing up at a Veterans Day parade with Confederate flags. Provocative? Deliberately. Offensive? Yes, to most. Hate crime? No. And yet Huffman blamed Donald Trump: “We need to prepare for more of this because the Trump campaign has legitimized and given public space to some shadowy groups that used to hide from public view. ” (For the record, Trump supported efforts to remove the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state capitol.) Meanwhile, thousands of people flood city centers in Los Angeles, Portland, New York and elsewhere, in some cases setting fires, smashing windows and vandalizing anything they can. Night after night, the protests have continued, organized by radical   organizations such as MoveOn. org and ANSWER, in rejection of the results of a democratic election. And some of the rhetoric of the protests has been bigoted, and violent. One sign at a Los Angeles protest Saturday read: “This Machine Kills Fascists. ” Some of the protests have resulted in violent attacks on police, and dozens of arrests. And there have been real hate crimes against Trump supporters, including a videotaped beating of a white man who was targeted because he was accused of voting for Trump. The wave of   crimes  —   “hate crimes” and otherwise  —   committed by   thugs overwhelms, by several orders of magnitude, whatever crimes are being attributed to Trump supporters. The narrative about a wave of “hate crimes” inspired by Trump is a deliberate fabrication, meant to tarnish the  . It is a continuation of false accusations, during the campaign, that Trump represented the second coming of Hitler. It is an attempt to organize a new opposition, based on lies, and the deliberate sowing of mistrust at a time when Americans have been called  —   by both presidential candidates  —   to come together.

[The Detroit News reports that “ ” is the driving force behind the surge in female gun buyers. Firearms instructor Nneka Lawrence says some of the women who come in still have tears in their eyes from an attack or assault they suffered while unarmed.  Lawrence is a black woman who has been teaching firearms training courses for ten years. She teaches at Action Impact and says: Our gun classes are like therapy session for these women. Some of them come in crying because they have been attacked before, raped, or robbed. Others want to simply protect themselves. The two things that come up in our classes is home invasion or being carjacked. One of Lawrence’s recent students was    Nita Brown, who lives on the Northwest side of Detroit. Brown said, “I lost my husband last year after we were married for 36 years. Because I’m home now by myself and we see a lot of seniors who are being targeted in home invasions, I do want to take it upon myself to learn how to use a gun. ” Another recent student,    Felicia Gentry, said: I live in a bad area near East Warren. It’s usually dark out when I go to work in the morning and when you call the cops they don’t come right away. Because my boyfriend works a midnight shift, we talked about me taking gun classes to protect myself when I leave at 6 a. m. to go work. In between the classroom work on firearms and the   shooting, Lawrence says the training also gives the women time to discuss what they have gone through: A lot of time when some of these women are attacked they think it’s a random act. I tell them if you go to the Meijer store for no reason, just to be there, maybe you could have avoided an incident where you got attacked. So you have to be conscious of your surrounding. I hear a lot of stories from the women in my class. But I feed off their stories and it is like I’m talking to my little sister. I think my aura in class allows them to   …     open up with me to share what has happened to them. Many of the women tell Lawrence that they used to fear owning guns. However, that fear was displaced or erased when the dangers of real life made it apparent that having a gun close at hand may prove to be the difference between life and death.

28804,28812,47574,Bangladesh Hikes Security After Top Islamist Hanged For War Crimes,Breitbart,AFP,2016-05-11,2016.0,5.0,,"Thousands of police were deployed Wednesday in Bangladesh after the main Islamist party’s leader was executed for war crimes, in a country reeling from a string of killings of secular and liberal activists.[   party president Motiur Rahman Nizami was hanged at Dhaka’s Central Jail late Tuesday, after the top court upheld his death sentence for the massacre of intellectuals during the 1971 war of independence with Pakistan.  Nizami, a    former government minister, was the fifth and the most senior opposition figure executed since the secular government set up a controversial war crimes tribunal in 2010. Police erected checkposts on major Dhaka roads to deter violent protests and officers and the elite Rapid Action Battalion were patrolling the capital, officials said.   “Several thousand policemen have been deployed in the capital as part of the stepped up security measures,” Dhaka police spokesman Maruf Hossain Sorder told AFP. Security was also tight in Nizami’s northwestern ancestral district of Pabna after his body was taken under armed escort overnight for burial in the family graveyard. “At least 16 activists of Jamaat were arrested Tuesday night as part of the security clampdown,” Pabna police inspector Ahsanul Haq told AFP. Jamaat has called a nationwide strike for Thursday in protest over Nizami’s execution. Executions of Jamaat officials in 2013 triggered the country’s deadliest violence in decades. Around 500 people were killed, mainly in clashes between Islamists and police.   But a fresh wave of bloodshed is considered unlikely following a major crackdown by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s government that has seen tens of thousands of Jamaat supporters arrested and detained. Mubashar Hasan, an assistant professor at Bangladesh’s University of Liberal Arts, said Tuesday’s execution sounded the death knell for the already embattled Jamaat. “With the execution of Nizami, the Jamaat leadership who revived the fortune of the party in the   period are now almost gone,” said Hasan. “It’s a big blow for the party. ” Hasan also warned that the execution and crackdown could further radicalise Jamaat supporters against the secular government in the   nation. “The party may have grievances and these grievances may lead to radicalisation, which would be suicidal,” he said.   The execution comes as Bangladesh is suffering from a wave of gruesome murders of secular bloggers, liberal activists and religious minorities by suspected Islamists. The Islamic State and a Bangladesh branch of   have claimed responsibility, but the government blames homegrown Islamists and accuses the opposition of trying to destabilise the country. Since last month an atheist student, two gay rights activists, a liberal professor, a Hindu tailor and a Sufi Muslim leader have been hacked to death.  —   Bloody chapter  —   In a statement on Wednesday, Jamaat reiterated that the charges against Nizami were false and aimed at eliminating the party’s leadership. But secular protesters cheered the hanging, with hundreds gathered outside the jail and at a square in central Dhaka overnight to celebrate what they called “a historic moment”.   Nizami took over as Jamaat leader in 2000 and played a key role in the victory of an   government in the 2001 general election. He was made a cabinet minister from  . The 1971 conflict, one of the bloodiest in world history, led to the creation of an independent Bangladesh from what was then East Pakistan. Prosecutors said Nizami was responsible for setting up the     militia, which killed top writers, doctors and journalists in the most gruesome chapter of the war. The trial heard Nizami ordered the killings, designed to “intellectually cripple” the fledgling nation. He was convicted in October 2014 by the International Crimes Tribunal, which has sentenced more than a dozen opposition leaders for war crimes. Rights groups say the trials fell short of global standards and lack international oversight, while the government says they are needed to heal the wounds of the conflict."

[In the month of September alone, a Turkish immigrant allegedly shot and killed five people in a Washington State mall an Afghan immigrant allegedly planted bombs in New York and New Jersey injuring roughly 30 innocent people a Somali immigrant allegedly stabbed nine people at a Minnesota mall a   illegal alien with a prior DUI conviction allegedly murdered a Kansas sheriff’s deputy an illegal alien and convicted child rapist allegedly shot two California corrections officers an illegal alien with a prior drug arrest, who had been a recipient of Obama’s executive amnesty, allegedly engaged in reckless driving killing a    girl a   deported illegal alien allegedly killed two people on what was described as a crime “rampage” and a Mexican immigrant and Arizona pastor was arrested after it was revealed that he had allegedly molested children for years, many of whom are believed to belong to his church, and for impregnating one of his victims when she was 13 years old.  At the same time, a Department of Homeland Security audit revealed that over 1, 800 foreign nationals who were slated to be deported were instead awarded U. S. citizenship. The below list is by no means exhaustive —  it is simply intended to highlight the scope and scale of the nation’s immigration crisis, which frequently goes unreported or dismissed by establishment media. While the media may report some of these crimes (such as the extensive coverage given to the New York City bombing or the Minnesota mall stabber) their reporting is almost always absent any immigration context. In addition to the crimes committed by people in the country illegally, this list includes crimes attached to individuals whom our government voluntarily chose to admit, or even decided to reward with U. S. citizenship. Got news tips? Email reporters Julia Hahn (jhahn@breitbart. com) and Katie McHugh (kmchugh@breitbart. com). Border Patrol agents arrested Francisco Javier   a Mexican national and   sex offender registered with the Texas Department of Public Safety. In 2008, Cruz was reportedly convicted of indecency with an 11   girl by sexual contact. The illegal alien had been previously deported on October 1, 2010 and has now been charged with illegal  . Juan Navarro Rios, 43, a   previously deported illegal alien was arrested for what was described as a crime “rampage. ” CBS described Rios as “a murderer, carjacker and kidnapper whose reign of terror spanned at least from the city of Dallas to just north of Austin. ” During his “reign of terror,” Rios allegedly shot to death a    man in his vehicle on the shoulder of Texas State Highway Spur 408, he then “opened fire on at least two other vehicles. ” Later that evening, Rios allegedly drove up next to Welton Betts, 44, as he was pumping gas at a Texaco gas station. He allegedly shot and killed Betts, forced Betts’ wife out of the car and stole the vehicle. Betts, a black American who had fallen in love and married his high school sweetheart and raised a family with her, has been described as “a typical Texan: he loved God, his family, hard work, the Cowboys, and his pickup truck. ” Reports note that Rios also allegedly “broke into a home, took the keys to a Lexus, and drove it to Georgetown, Texas, where it was found abandoned. He is also believed to have kidnapped a man at gunpoint Monday morning and then trying to force him to withdraw money from an ATM. Rios set fire to his sister’s apartment in Georgetown, broke through a wall into a neighbor’s apartment, and tried to flee before being captured. He had a gun nearby. ” According to reports, Rios had multiple criminal charges in Williamson County, including felony possession of a controlled substance and burglary of a vehicle. ABC’s WFAA reports that Rios “had so many aliases —  at least eight by last count —  that police aren’t even sure of his real name  …     Records also revealed that he had crossed the U. S.  border at least 35 times, using a passport with a fake name. ” Reports note that the illegal criminal alien was   in his Hispanic community. “In a largely   neighborhood in southern Dallas, everybody knew Juan Navarro Rios as ‘flaco’ [Spanish for ‘skinny’]. ” Two Mexican nationals,    Fernando Limon and    Ramiro Limon, were arrested and are facing four counts of rape of a child. According to reports, the child victims involved were “considerably younger than the    age limit sentencing guidelines involving adults charged with sex crimes against children. ”    Arcan Cetin, a Turkish immigrant, allegedly shot and killed four women and one man at a Washington State mall. It was originally reported Cetin was in the country as a lawful permanent resident, but not a U. S. citizen. However, after documentation surfaced showing he had registered to vote in 2014 and had in fact voted in three elections, new reports now indicate Cetin is a naturalized U. S. citizen. On Twitter, Cetin indicated that he had planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. Cecil Burrows, 23, a known gang member originally from the slums of Mumbai, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in the 2012 gang rape of a   teenage girl. Burrows decided to record the gang rape on video. Burrows came to the U. S. when he was 12 years old and promptly joined a gang. Even still, the government rewarded him with lawful permanent resident status. The 2012 gang rape was not Burrows’ first   with the law. In 2011, he was charged with theft, but a judge was apparently lenient with him and reportedly spared him jail time, allowing him to go back on the streets and eventually take part in a gang rape the following year. Reports note that the gang rape might never have come to light if one of Burrows’ fellow gang members hadn’t bragged about the rape to his   and showed him the “funny” video recording of the rape, which he had saved on his cellphone. The Washington Post reports that on the   audio recording of the rape, Burrows can be heard “like a coach” giving instructions to the men on how to rape the girl. “The victim could be heard screaming and saying in slurred speech to stop,” the Post writes. “As the recording continues, Burrows could be heard giving instructions, at one point asking, ‘Who’s next? ’” During a   operation, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 47 illegal aliens from the Washington D. C. and Virginia area who had previously been convicted of crimes. According to ICE’s press release: Fermin Rivera, 28, allegedly beat a puppy to death while trying to break into a neighborhood home. During the attempted burglary, Rivera had broken into the backyard but was met with barking by a small puppy. Surveillance cameras show Rivera subsequently “cornered the   mix, lifted the dog over his head and slammed it down with all his strength on the concrete slab twice. ” River is now reportedly “facing felony counts of animal cruelty charges and attempted burglary charges. ” Rivera is reportedly on an immigration hold. An audit of the Department of Homeland Security released   revealed that 1, 811 foreign nationals, who were supposed to be deported, were instead given U. S. citizenship. The Obama administration shut down the whistleblowing operation that uncovered the massive fraud. Border Patrol agents arrested Milton Omar Perez, a   Salvadoran national convicted of sexual assault against a child, as he attempted to illegally   the U. S. Jorge Huge   41, an illegal alien, confessed to having strangled and beaten to death his      wife, Kara Willingham. Local news reports note that Willingham “was working toward becoming a Registered Nurse so she could help others. ” Willingham is survived by her two young children. Mexican national Edwardo Gallardo was arrested by Border Patrol agents just nine days after he had been deported. According to reports, Gallardo was formally deported on September 9. Gallardo had previously served time in federal prison for illegal   in 2014. Somali immigrant Dahir Adan, who reportedly immigrated to the United States 15 years ago, allegedly stabbed nine people at the Crossroads Center mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota before an   police officer shot and killed him. Adan was reportedly shouting “Allahu Akbar!” during the rampage, and one eyewitness said that Adan asked people in the mall whether they were Muslim. Afghan immigrant Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was identified as the suspect responsible for bombings in New Jersey and New York City. Rahami was born in Afghanistan in 1988 and came to the U. S. in 1995. In 2011, the government rewarded Rahami with U. S. citizenship —  granting him all of the protections and benefits that citizenship affords, including the right to vote. Victor Manuel   a 22   illegal alien, confessed to killing Maricarmen   a    Texas AM student in her   apartment. The illegal alien, who was reportedly dating the woman, shot her during an argument. He also accidentally shot himself in the hand. Adrian   a   arrested illegal alien with a prior DUI conviction, allegedly killed a Kansas sheriff’s deputy.   38, was allegedly driving drunk when he crashed his car into the patrol vehicle of Sheriff’s Department Master Deputy Brandon Collins, 45. The Daily Caller reports that “  was previously arrested for DUI in California in 2001 and a traffic violation in Overland Park, Kansas in 2013. ” He was cited for driving without a license and paid a $121 fine after pleading guilty. The Daily Caller writes: “ICE has said they were not notified of either of those arrests. Overland Park is located in Johnson County, which is a ‘sanctuary county’ [  …    ] 41 Action News reported that the Overland park police department that arrested him in 2013 said didn’t notify ICE because, ‘it could be considered profiling because a lot of people of all races are arrested without a proper ID. ’” The Kansas City Star reports that Deputy Collins “would have celebrated his 21st anniversary with the department next month. ” He is survived by his wife and two daughters. Breitbart’s Lee Stranahan reports: An Ethiopian immigrant who was working as a Certified Nursing Assistant in Portland, Oregon is behind bars, charged with rape, unlawful sexual penetration and other sexual contact with patients who were 87 and 94 years old. Around a half dozen other alleged victims came forward after the September 14 arrest of Adeladilew A. Mekonen and he is likely to face “many more charges,” the Washington County Sheriff’s Department confirmed to Breitbart News. As the online record of who is in custody in Washington County shows, the    suspect is currently facing 18 charges. Illegal alien Fernando Fernel   18, faces criminal charges of homicide by reckless driving, two counts of serious injury by reckless driving, child endangerment, operating without a driver’s license and no insurance. On September 8, Aguilar allegedly was speeding when he ran a stop sign and caused a fatal multiple vehicle accident that resulted in the death of a    girl and injured four others. According to reports, Aguilar “told investigators that he had known for at least three days the brakes in his car had been malfunctioning, but he drove the vehicle anyway. ”   is a   “DREAMer” who was exempted from U. S. immigration law by President Obama’s executive amnesty (DACA) for illegal aliens who allegedly arrived in the country as minors. Hillary Clinton is campaigning on protecting and expanding Obama’s executive amnesty. This was not Lopez Aguilar’s first criminal offense: In June, he received a citation of the possession of drug paraphernalia. Pastor Jose Vicente Morales was arrested and faces charges of sexual abuse, child molestation and sexual conduct with a minor. ABC15 reports that, allegedly, “Morales had been molesting children for years” and had “impregnated one of the victims when she was 13 years of age. ” Some of his victims were reportedly members of his church. “One victim accused Morales of molesting her from ages seven to 12, she said she was molested once while in a pool as she was swimming with the man,” ABC15 writes. “Police report that when Morales came to Arizona in 1986 at age 19, he dated an    girl and married her in Mexico when she was 10. After returning to Arizona, he impregnated her when she was just 13. ” Ignacio Andrade Duarte,      who was in the country on a guest worker permit, was denied his motion to withdraw from a plea deal in which he had confessed to two separate incidents in 2014 where he sexually touched a    and a    girl. Duarte pled guilty to one count of child molestation and one count of attempted sexual abuse of a minor. Nogales International reports: “Despite the nature of the charges against him and the fact that he is a citizen of another county, Andrade was never arrested or ordered to post bond. Even after he pleaded guilty, Deputy County Attorney Kimberly Hunley did not ask the judge to have him taken into custody. Andrade fled the state after his    hearing and was eventually arrested in California on Feb. 19 after a nationwide manhunt. ” Michael Steven Sanford, an illegal alien from Great Britian who had overstayed his tourist visa, pled guilty to the illegal possession of a firearm, which he tried to steal from a police officer, in his effort to allegedly murder Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump at a June campaign event. Sanford also pled guilty to disrupting the orderly conduct of government business and official functions. According to The Associated Press, psychiatrists found that Sanford was “delusional. ” Oscar   an illegal Salvadoran national who had been deported twice in the past two years and was a known   gang member, was arrested and charged for allegedly stabbing a Maryland teenager to death. Back in June, the illegal alien and his accomplices allegedly stabbed Christian   18, “more than 40 times in a park  …     as he begged for his life,” the Washington Post reports. “  ‘directed’ the attack. ” Detectives told the Post that   likely murdered the teen over “gang bragging rights. ” When police apprehended   he reportedly told them, “If I hadn’t been drunk this morning, you guys would never have caught me. ” Illegal alien and Salvadoran national, Elias Josael Jimenes Avardo, 21, was charged with murder of a    woman, Ranarda Williams, in Northwest Baltimore. Police say he is also considered to be a suspect in the murder of another woman, Annquinnette Dates, 48, that took place just one week earlier. Dates and Williams were found strangled to death. Walter Gomes DaSilva, a Brazilian national and   deported illegal criminal alien convicted of trying to kill his wife, reportedly “grinned widely” as he pled guilty to murdering his teenage daughter. The 45   father, who has a “Kiss My Ass” tattoo around his neck, was convicted in 2002 and served 10 years in prison for trying to murder his wife. The Boston Herald reports he “vowed to see his teenage daughter ‘in hell’ as he shot her in the face and pumped her back full of bullets for snubbing him on Father’s Day. ” Two Ecuadorian nationals, Paul Esteban Estrella Villota, 40, and his wife Magaly Alemania Malagon Sandoya, 42, were respectively sentenced to six and five years in federal prison. ICE described the Ecuadorian couple as “ring leaders of an alien smuggling organization that smuggled juveniles into the United States. ” According to ICE, the couple pled guilty to “conspiracy to commit alien smuggling for financial gain resulting in bodily injury, which included a smuggled girl being repeatedly raped by her smugglers. ” Police issued an arrest warrant for Elda Graciela Margez De Zamora, who goes by the name “Mama Elda. ” Zamora was charged with two felony counts for running an illegal, unlicensed dentistry practice out of her Phoenix apartment. ABC15 reports “she told authorities she would return to Mexico if she were released from custody. ” The arrest warrant was issued in earlier September after she failed to show up to a court hearing. Nicodemo   a Mexican national who has been deported five times within the past four years and has prior criminal convictions including three DUIs, is now being investigated in at least 10 cases of sexual assault as well as aggravated kidnapping. Police described   as a “potential serial sexual assault predator. ” KXAN reports that   tried to light one woman on fire with gasoline in an empty field, but the woman was able to escape. The next day,   allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted “a    woman after picking her up from a bus stop and taking her to his ‘garden. ’” Border Patrol arrested Francisco Javier   a   convicted murderer, as he, once again, tried to illegally   the United States. As Tucson News Now reports:   was previously convicted in Mexico for the 2003 murder of U. S. Border Patrol agent  …     [who] had been traveling   when   attacked him for being a BP agent.   served 11 years in prison for the killing. This is not the first time BP agents have arrested   in 2002 he was apprehended by the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office for possession of marijuana for transport or sale. He served 108 days in county jail for that offense.   now faces prosecution by the U. S. Attorney’s Office for illegal   of an aggravated felon. Thong Vang, a    illegal Laotian national and convicted child rapist, allegedly shot and critically injured two unarmed California corrections officers. Vang had previously served sixteen years in prison for his ties to   sex ring and for raping three girls under the age of 14. As the Fresno Bee reports, “Court records say Vang was once a leader in the Mongolian Boys Society, a Fresno street gang that engaged in a   ring at a local Motel 6 in the 1990s. ” Following Vang’s parole in 2014, he was supposed to be deported. Instead, Vang was released into the U. S. interior. Immigration experts say he was released to roam free because Hillary Clinton failed to follow U. S. immigration law and take actions to force his home country to take him back. Jose Edelberto Garcia, a Salvadoran illegal alien and convicted felon who had at least three additional misdemeanors, was arrested on charges of first degree forcible rape and first degree force sex offense. Four Mexican nationals (Bernabe   28, Carlos   51, Julia   50, and Cristobal   43) were indicted for their alleged participation in a “  meth ring. ” The Houston Chronicle reports that investigators from the Drug Enforcement Administration believe the defendants moved more than 15 pounds of methamphetamine. Both   and   were previously rewarded with legal status as lawful permanent residents."
28892,28900,47662,"Three Female Joggers Raped, Murdered, As Violent Crime Rises In Obama’s America - Breitbart",Breitbart,Katie McHugh,2016-08-10,2016.0,8.0,,"Unknown killers have murdered three young   women on jogging paths in a single week, underlining the nationwide rise in violent crime and Americans’ growing worries about safety in their own neighborhoods. [Nurse Ally Brueger: Shot and murdered while jogging alone in Detroit, Michigan on July 31.  Athlete Karina Vetrano: Raped and murdered August 2 in an   neighborhood in Queens while jogging alone through a weeded area where “hobos and bums” are known to lurk and residents fear to go. Google manager Vanessa Marcotte: Raped, murdered, and set on fire August 7 while jogging alone in her quiet Massachusetts hometown. The establishment media is producing many stories about black criminals being shot in sharp encounter with police officers, but is ignoring the nationwide rise in crime as President Barack Obama pushes his “  ” campaign against local and state law enforcement agencies. Obama is using clever   to hide the crime rise since 2015. “Ronald Reagan called America ‘a shining city on a hill.’ Donald Trump calls it ‘a divided crime scene’ that only he can fix,” Obama said at the Democratic National Convention. “It doesn’t matter to him that illegal immigration and the crime rate are as low as they’ve been in decades, because he’s not offering any real solutions to those issues. ” Public concern over crime stands at a   high, according to Gallup.   percent of all respondents  —   along 68 percent of nonwhites  —   told pollsters they worry about crime “a great deal” in April, which is a sharp increase from 2014. That poll was taken before a   Muslim slaughtered 49 Americans in a gay Orlando nightclub, and before black militants murdered police in planned attacks, including five officers in a single night in Dallas alone. The   illegal alien crime, race riots burning down cities, and a raging heroin epidemic that’s claimed tens of thousands of American lives also contribute to these worries. Trump has promised to reverse the rising crime rates. “An attack on law enforcement is an attack on all Americans. I have a message to every last person threatening the peace on our streets and the safety of our police: when I take the oath of office next year, I will restore law and order our country. Believe me. Believe me,” he said at the Republican National Convention. “I will work with, and appoint, the best prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the country to get the job done. In this race for the White House, I am the Law And Order candidate. ” Many voters agreed with Trump  —   leading CNN to trash their own poll that showed 56 percent of those who watched Trump’s speech were more likely to vote for him. And the violent crime rate is indeed rising, as Breitbart News has extensively covered: Voters’ support for law and order is growing as the death toll from the   murder spike nears 1, 500. The murder toll is highlighted in a new survey published by the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) which reveals that 2, 308 murders have been committed in their cities during the first half of 2016, versus 2, 001 in the first half of 2015. That’s a huge 15 percent increase, coming after a roughly 17 percent rise in the nation’s major cities during 2015. In 2015, the association reported 6, 192 murders in their cities, up by 837 from 2014. That increased 2015 murder rate will have added roughly 300 dead to the first six months of 2016. Then add the 307 deaths that comprise the additional 2016 increase, creating an estimated death toll of roughly 1, 500 dead Americans since 2014. An analysis of crime rates in 20 major cities published in the Washington Post explained that Obama and the Koch Brothers, who both back dangerous “prison break” legislation, are not honestly representing crime data: In June, well before Obama’s remarks and most of the   of Trump’s claims, Richard Rosenfeld of the University of Missouri at St. Louis documented, in a study of 56 major cities conducted for the Justice Department, that homicides were up 17 percent on average. Forty of the cities saw homicides increase, and 12 of those cities saw them increase by more than 50 percent. Furthermore, data collected by the Major Cities Chiefs Association indicate that this trend has continued into 2016. In the first half of the year, homicides are up 15 percent over 2015.   shootings (up 4 percent) and aggravated assaults (3. 4 percent) both jumped in the first half of the year as well. Our own analysis of 20 large cities, gathered directly from publicly available police department data, finds that crime is rising overall, although the increases are spread unevenly across the country. And compared with 2014 lows, some types of violent crimes are not just rising they are rising at alarming rates. For example, since 2014, violent crime is up 47 percent in Los Angeles, 26 percent in Baltimore and 23 percent in Dallas. In Chicago, arguably the   city, homicides have risen more than 70 percent since 2014. With almost 400 murders to date, the Windy City is on track to tally more than 650 murders this year alone  —   the most in almost two decades. The death toll continues to rise. Ally Brueger, her parents’ only child, will never treat another patient in need. “HUGE heart, always smiling and so good at her job,” one patient wrote after her murder. Karina Vetrano will never go on another run with her father, who found his beloved daughter in a marsh with broken teeth, covered in bruises, and her sports bra and pants pulled down. Vanessa Marcotte will never again see her hometown, or her mother or father, who are now begging for justice for their only child."
28965,28973,47735,Victims of Alien Crime: Cruz Commits ’Treason’ in Alliance with Kasich - Breitbart,Breitbart,Julia Hahn,2016-04-26,2016.0,4.0,,"Certain American victims of illegal alien crime say Sen. Ted Cruz should be “charged with treason” for his decision to team up with   Governor John Kasich in order to nullify the votes of Donald Trump supporters. [“They both ought to be charged with treason,” said Billy Inman, whose son    Dustin was murdered while he and his family were on their way to celebrate an early Father’s Day family fishing trip. An illegal alien   the family’s vehicle at over 60 mph. His son’s murderer is still roaming free.  “Their teaming up should ruin Ted Cruz’s career,” said Cruz constituent Laura Wilkerson whose    son Joshua was tied up, beaten, strangled, set on fire, and tortured to death by his illegal alien classmate. “Who do they think they are trying to silence us?” asked Mary Ann Mendoza, whose    son, Sgt. Brandon Mendoza, was murdered by a drunk illegal alien who had been driving the wrong way down a freeway with a blood alcohol level three times the legal limit. “If Republicans wanted either Cruz or Kasich as a candidate, they would be voting for them,” Mendoza said. Instead “the two of them are trying to bully their OWN mindset on us. Republican voters are voting for the person they feel will make our country great again. Something like this has got to make people wonder, why are these career politicians so afraid of Mr. Trump?” When asked to respond to the statements from the victims of illegal alien crime, Cruz’s spokeswoman Alice Stewart said: Having Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in November would be a sure disaster for Republicans.  Not only would Trump get blown out by Clinton or Sanders, but having him as our nominee would set the party back a generation. To ensure that we nominate a Republican who can unify the Republican Party and win in November, our campaign will focus its time and resources in Indiana and in turn clear the path for Gov. Kasich to compete in Oregon and New Mexico, and we would hope that allies of both campaigns would follow our lead.  In other states holding their elections for the remainder of the primary season, our campaign will continue to compete vigorously to win. Throughout his campaign, Cruz has had to fend off charges leveled against him by   immigration expansionist Sen. Marco Rubio that his and Cruz’s positions on immigration are not “dramatically different”. Indeed, Cruz has sought to explain his statements from 2013, in which he declared, “I want immigration reform to pass” and in which he urged “people of good faith on both sides of the aisle” to compromise in order to “pass   immigration reform” that “allows those that are here illegally to come in out of the shadows. ” The victims of illegal alien crime argue that Cruz’s decision to team up with   Kasich to stop Trump undermines Cruz’s argument that he cares about securing the nation’s border. As Breitbart News has previously reported, Kasich’s extreme statements on immigration place him to the furthest leftward reaches of not just the Republican field, but the Democratic Presidential field as well. For instance, not only has Kasich pledged that he would enact amnesty within his first 100 days in office, but Kasich has also previously said illegal immigrants are a “critical part of our society. ” Kasich has said that enforcing the nation’s immigration laws in not “the kind of values that we believe in” Kasich has likened deporting the illegal population to Japanese interment camps he has compared illegal immigration to cutting in line at a Taylor Swift concert and he has suggested that America can’t deport illegal immigrants because they are “made in the image of the Lord”. “Cruz is just a talker,” Inman said, arguing that Cruz’s decision to team up with Kasich suggests that he does not have any intention to actually secure the nation’s border as President. “He can just talk and talk, but there’s never any action  …     My son died in vain. ” “Ted Cruz is all about theater and controlling the opposition by pretending to lead it,” said Cruz constituent Dan Golvach. While Cruz was in the U. S. Senate, Golvach’s    son Spencer was randomly shot by an illegal alien who decided to use Spencer’s “head as target practice. ” “What the two puppets are doing is nothing more than what they are told to do,” Golvach said of Cruz and Kasich’s decision to join forces. Golvach said that Cruz and Kasich’s “sugar daddies are shaking in their boots because they know Trump will expose them and expose their lawless deeds that have not only hurt American workers, but also left them vulnerable to all manners of crime including joy killing, as in the case of my    son  …     It’s treasonous and they will continue to get away with it if we keep supporting their puppets. ” Both Golvach and Wilkerson say that Cruz has never “reached out to a Texas American family that has lost a loved one” at the hands of an illegal alien. “Cruz and Kasich teaming up should speak loudly to the American public that America’s choice for POTUS doesn’t matter at all,” Wilkerson said. “The establishment is hell bent on making that clear. ” “It might be within the rules, but it’s highly immoral and disrespectful to the electorate,” Golvach said. Mendoza explained: We are painfully watching the slow death of the Republican Party in front of our eyes. If Cruz and Kasich believe that they’re going to unite the Republican Party by doing something like this, they have a rude awakening about to happen  …     their actions are sending clear message to American that we NEED Mr. Trump as our president to stop all the special interests and corruption that happens daily with our current politicians. Why aren’t we all as Americans standing up to this crap? [  …    ] What we need to be asking is: Who is REALLY behind this latest scheme they have cooked up? “Trump ought to rip up his Republican Party pledge,” Inman said citing the Republican establishment’s treatment of its Party’s frontrunner. “He ought to rip it up. ” Inman said that watching Cruz team up with the   members of the Establishment reveals that Cruz is simply a “puppet in a puppet show. ” “How can Cruz say those things about someone and then pretend like he’s their best friend?” Inman said. “It shows Cruz is just a puppet. Watching these professional politicians interact is just like watching a puppet show. It’s all a puppet show. Trump is the only one who isn’t a puppet. There ain’t anybody pulling his strings. ”"

On December 18, 2016, the UK’s Express reported that Jeffrey Pang —  an employee of Joh Springer’s, Austria’s oldest gun store —  said the buying “surge in firearm sales coincided with reports of robberies, rapes and   since the migrant crisis began. ” He added, “Following the rise in attacks, customers want pepper sprays, combat training, small concealed carry weapons. ” “Our security level has diminished in the last couple months. You see the crowds They’re shouting, they’re drinking, there is no security anymore,” Pang said. The Express indicates that Pang and others, like attorney Anna K, were interviewed by NRATV about the sharp increase in firearm purchases. Anna said she was “very open to the migrants” when the process began, then realized “it was very dangerous” for Austrians after only a few months. “Ten years ago, it was no problem to go running in the park or go home by metro,” Anna said. “But not now, I don’t feel safe anymore. I never thought about having to defend myself I did not think it was necessary. But I felt myself as a foreigner in my own country. ” AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

29468,29476,48240,"FBI, LAPD Cannot Confirm Anti-Muslim Letters as ’Hate Crime’",Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,2016-11-28,2016.0,11.0,,"LOS ANGELES  —   Law enforcement officials gathered with local Muslim leaders at the Islamic Center of Southern California to respond to threatening letters that had been sent to several mosques in the state. [The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) could not, however, confirm that the letters actually came from outside the community, or that they were not a prank. And the Los Angeles Police Department said that the letters were being investigated as a “hate incident,” not a “hate crime,” because there was no specific, immediate threat.  Stephen Woolery, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Counterterrorism Division in Los Angeles, said that at least five letters were received by Islamic institutions in California. Letters were received in San Jose, Northridge, Claremont, Signal Hill, and Los Angeles. He added that there was possibly one more letter that had been received outside the state, possibly in Georgia. One letter, widely circulated in the media, read, in part: “You Muslims are a vile and filthy people   …     There’s a new sheriff in town  —   President Donald Trump. He’s going to cleanse America   …     He’s going to do to you Muslims what Hitler did to the Jews. ” The language of each of the letters was similar, officials said. They did not contain a specific threat of violence. Officials were confident that they would be able to trace the source of the letters. Woolery said that the first report about the letters had emerged on Thanksgiving, from the Bay Area, though most of the letters had appeared in Southern California. Woolery told Breitbart News that all that was certain at this point was that the letters were delivered via U. S. Postal Service. Asked specifically whether the letters might be a prank, he said all that was known was that they had arrived by regular mail. He said that there is no actual FBI investigation ongoing at this time. He also said there was no known connection to the first anniversary of the San Bernardino terror attack on Dec. 2.  Local Muslim leaders at the press conference, which involved both local and international media, invited the author or authors of the letter to have a frank discussion about faith. “We want this to be out in the open, in broad daylight. Bullies feel emboldened in dark alleys. Dr. Sayed Moustafa   the president of the Shia Muslim Council of Southern California, said: “We stand against hate crime and against terrorism. ” He advised members of the community to go about their normal activities. Another Muslim leader responded to a suspected terror attack earlier in the day at Ohio State, where several people were injured in an attack, apparently carried out by a Muslim immigrant from Somalia, involving a car and knives. “The problem comes when we politicize one incident over others   …     when the reality is, it’s just violence,” he said. Woolery stressed that there was little risk of an actual attack by the author of the letters. “Typically, behavior like this never precedes an attack  —   they never give us warning,” he told Breitbart News. He added that such incidents of hate mail were typically  . He said that the FBI had wanted to participate in the press conference, despite the lack of an investigation, “to be visible, strong partners with our community. Our role is to monitor the situation   …     making sure there is no threat. ” “It was important for us to be here to demonstrate that partnership, because I think that’s important to the community. ” Joel B.

[In what the agency terms a “targeted enforcement action,” ICE officers with Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) arrested 25 criminal aliens from February 29 through March 4.  In keeping with the administration’s   “enforcement priorities”  —   which largely only enforces immigration law against those illegal immigrants who have committed a bad enough crime  —   the arrested criminal aliens had all committed offenses that met the administration’s top two priority levels. Per the administration’s enforcement priorities  —   released in conjunction with President Obama’s November 2014 executive amnesty programs  —   “Priority 1” illegal immigrants are those who are a national security threat, gang member,   those convicted of felonies. “Priority 2” include illegal immigrants convicted of three or more misdemeanors or of “significant” misdemeanors, including  . “ICE prioritizes convicted criminals and public safety threats for apprehension and removal,” Marc J. Moore, field office director for the Miami ERO Field Office, said in a statement. “Our enforcement actions last week made our communities safer today. ” According to ICE, offenses committed by those illegal immigrants arrested included manslaughter, child abuse, robbery, false imprisonment, felony DUI, hit and run, armed burglary, racketeering, and weapons and drug offenses. The arrestees’ countries of origin included Ecuador, the United Kingdom, Morocco, Mexico, Turks  Caicos, El Salvador, Jamaica, Trinidad, Canada, England, and Guyana. In recent years the Obama administration has come under fire for releasing criminal illegal immigrants back into the U. S. rather than deporting them. Monday, the Center for Immigration Studies released a report detailing how since 2010, 124 criminal aliens released by “Obama administration policies” went on to be charged with murder. Recent estimates pin the number of criminal aliens with deportation orders currently at large in the U. S. at 179, 000. According to ICE, “  percent of ICE’s fiscal 2015 removals and returns fell into one or more of ICE’s civil immigration enforcement priorities, with 86 percent falling in Priority 1 and eight percent in Priority 2. ”"
29642,29650,48414,Congress Moving to Make Cop-Killing a ’Hate Crime’ - Breitbart,Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,2016-07-19,2016.0,7.0,,"Congressional legislation titled “Blue Lives Matter,” which would make cop killing a “hate crime,” will move to a floor vote in September, despite having no Democrat support. [With    gunfire deaths of police up 94 percent 16 Republican sponsors will bring the Blue Lives Matter Act, to debate and a floor vote when the U. S. House and Senate return from their summer recess.  There have been 66 police officers and 24 police K9s who have died in the line of duty in 2016, according to the “Officer Down Memorial” web site. That is actually 3 percent better than total deaths by this time last year. Although automobile accidents and automobile assaults have historically been the largest contributor police officer fatalities, the recent ambush assassinations of police officers in a number of states has almost doubled the number of deaths associated with gunfire this year. The Louisiana legislature recently passed a “Blue Lives Matter” law at the state level, and Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards, whose family includes four generations of police officers, signed it in May to add up to five years to prison sentences for “targeting” police. The covered classes include police, firefighters and emergency medical responders, on a list of “hate crime” criteria including race, age, gender, religion, color, creed, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, or ancestry. The Louisiana debate pitted police unions and other safety unions, which usually lean Democrat, against an array of civil rights groups that claimed police have not faced the historic discrimination that hate crime designation was supposed to address. But the movement for a national “Blue Lives Matter Act” has accelerated after television coverage of the horrific targeting of police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge. Kyle Huwa, a spokesman for the federal bill’s author, Colorado Republican Rep. Ken Buck, told Reuters, “Since the Baton Rouge tragedy, we’ve received calls and messages from around the country from individuals asking about the ‘Blue Lives Matter Act’ and we’re confident more members of Congress will be   the legislation as soon as they can when Congress reconvenes. ” The “Blue Lives Matter” movement is a reaction to the “Black Lives Matter” movement, which arose in the wake of allegations of police udeliberately sing lethal force against black men. President Obama, Vice President Biden and Attorney General Loretta Lynch met with six leaders of ‘The Fraternal Order of Police Executives’ on July 11, following the assassination of five police officers in Dallas by a man allegedly inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement the week before. The President compared the Dallas deaths to “horrible shootings not too long ago in Charleston at the church where Dylann Roof killed a number of black people. ” Obama claimed that there was no need for Blue Lives Matter legislation, because the Dallas shooter, were he still alive, “most certainly would” be prosecuted by the federal government for a hate crime and subject to harsher penalties. When pressed by the Fraternal Order members regarding the Blue Lives Matter legislation, Obama was noncommittal. Allison   regional director for the   division of the   League (ADL) told the   Mother Jones magazine that adding police officers to the hate crime list “distorts the purpose of the original legislation. ” The ADL claims that the law should protect people who are victimized because of immutable characteristics, something that someone cannot change about themselves or should not have to change about themselves. ADL opposes Blue Live Matter legislation because “occupation is temporary and an inherently different kind of attribute. ”"

He said: I’m trying to figure out if black lives really matter, then in Chicago alone the murder rate has soared 72 percent in 2016.   percent in the first three months of 2016 compared to last year.

[They can start with the   web hits defaming Stephen K. Bannon as  .  First, the obligatory disclaimer clearing a good man being defamed. I have known Steve Bannon for nearly two decades. During that time, we have enjoyed frank dinnertime conversations about public policy and political philosophy. He’s never uttered a single word that would suggest any racist or   views. The mainstream media would know this if they bothered with some real reporting. “I have worked with Stephen K. Bannon,   Donald Trump’s new chief strategist and senior counselor, for nearly six years at Breitbart News,”attests Joel Pollak, Senior    at Breitbart News. “I can say, without hesitation, that Steve is a friend of the Jewish people and a defender of Israel, as well as being a passionate American patriot and a great leader. ” Pollak’s defense of Bannon carries added significance. An Orthodox Jew, Pollak wrote his Master’s thesis in Jewish Studies on “the troubled status of Jews in an increasingly   and antisemitic,   South Africa. ” He adds, “It defies logic that a man who was a close friend, confidant, and adviser to the late Andrew Breitbart  —   a proud Jew  —   could have any negative feelings towards Jews. ” Even the   League has begun to back away from its attacks. “We are not aware of any   statements from Bannon,” the organization concludes. The mainstream media made a fatal error in constructing this bogus narrative. Stephen Bannon’s work at Breitbart. com, which is being used as Exhibit A in the media’s indictment against him, is a   success story. “They say that we are ‘’ though our company was founded by Jews, is largely staffed by Jews, and has an entire section (Breitbart Jerusalem) dedicated to reporting on and defending the Jewish state of Israel,” Breitbart News CEO Larry Solov and    Alex Marlow said back in August, when Hillary Clinton’s campaign first placed the   narrative. Are we to believe that a raging   secretly harbored   views while working alongside a team of Jewish writers and editors, or that Breitbart. com’s outspoken,   provocateurs have suddenly become timid wallflowers? “Calling Steve Bannon an antisemite is a ” explains nationally syndicated radio talk show host and   Dennis Prager. “It’s just a libel, it’s fabricated, the whole thing is fabricated. ” Conservatives should ask ourselves why. Why has the mainstream media targeted Bannon with this fabricated story? Bannon’s crime was providing us deplorables with an alternative source for news.  In October, Breitbart News generated more than 240 million page views from 37 million unique visitors. Much of that success is owed to the vision established by Bannon as the alternative media outlet’s Executive Chairman. The Steve Bannon   has had nothing to do with racism or  . It’s the mainstream media’s attempt to regain control."

In Venice the rise in crime has shown itself in the theft of “packages from doorsteps  …    smartphones [stolen] from pedestrians and [attempts] to steal cars during the day. ” In southeastern parts of LA, the problem is gang crime.

She wants, he said, Wants them to take away any chance they have of survival. And by the way, you have men and women sitting in an apartment, and there’s tremendous crime, crime of all kinds, and they need to be protected. And you know the only way they’re going to be able to protect themselves  —   and if you take that gun away from them, it’s going to be a very unfair situation. “And that’s why we’re going to call her Heartless Hillary,” he said. “Americans use guns to defend themselves against violent crime more than a million times a year,” Trump continued. “More than a million times a year. And they want to take them away. ” “Heartless hypocrites like the Clintons want to take this and they want to get rid of guns, and yet they have bodyguards that have guns. So I think that in addition to calling for them to name [Supreme Court] judges, we’ll also call them and let their bodyguards immediately disarm,” he said as the audience applauded. They should immediately disarm. And let’s see how good they do. Let’s see how good they feel walking around without their guns on their bodyguards. In the meantime, nobody else can have the guns, right? Trump also criticized the Obama administration’s rush to reduce sentences for criminals: Obama and his appointees are seeking to release as many as 70, 000 federal prisoners without approval from Congress, according to GOP critics, including Sen. Tom Cotton. That number is roughly   of all federal inmates. “President Obama also tried to take the guns from Americans and yet reduced prosecutions of violent criminals who use guns,” he said. “President Obama is even releasing violent criminals from the jails, including drug dealers and those with gun crimes. And they’re being let go by the thousands. By the thousands. ” Many of these are also —  I’m sure you’re not going to be surprised to hear this —  illegal immigrants. President Obama pushed for changes to sentencing laws that released thousands of dangerous,   felons and gang members who prey on civilians. “This is Hillary Clinton’s agenda, too,” he added later in the speech. “To release the violent criminals from jail. She wants them all released. She wants people released that you wouldn’t want to walk on the street with, you wouldn’t want to look at. And whether it’s Kate in San Francisco —  you see what happened there —  and Jamiel. I’ve become great friends with his father. Jamiel was shot in the face three times by somebody that wasn’t supposed to be here. ” “Or, and I always say this, because this was tragic, a    veteran, a woman who was a great woman, raped, sodomized, and killed by an illegal immigrant,” Trump said, referring to the   of Air Force veteran Marilyn Pharis in a California “sanctuary” county last July. “We’re going to straighten it out,” Trump said. Clinton is putting the most vulnerable Americans at risk with her    and open borders policies, Trump said. “This is a risk we can no longer afford. We’ve had enough. I think we’ve had enough. ”"

There’s a prime example. ” “In the Black community in this country, there is over $1 trillion in assets. There are less than ten countries in the world that have a trillion dollar GDP.

[The report, whose release was delayed from July, and again in September, was finally published in November. It records a total of 436, 387 crimes over the past year  —   a dramatic 31. 6 per cent increase on the year before, reports Die Welt.  The German Federal Police are tasked primarily with the protection of railway stations, airports, and borders. Most of the recorded thefts occurred at either railway stations or on trains with 44, 800 cases reported  —   up 25 per cent from the year before. In total, thefts have risen 11. 9 per cent to 57, 146 cases. The report blames much of the crime on organised migrant gangs, many of them originating from the Balkans. The largest increase in crime by far, however, involves migrants and the violation of asylum laws including illegal immigration and people smuggling, with an increase of 151. 6 per cent totally 171, 477 violations over the past year. Police President Dieter Romann has been a vocal critic of the border and migrant policies of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr. Romann highlighted the fact that 865, 374 migrants illegally entered Germany’s borders in the past year, the majority coming after Ms. Merkel invited the migrants at the beginning of September 2015. Many of those who came illegally did so via people smugglers. The report states the majority of smugglers to be Syrian with 390 of them arrested in the past year. This was followed by Romanians, at 370, and Hungarians, at 362. Minister of the Interior Thomas de Maizière has said the government will use covert methods to crack down on the huge smuggling trade, which some have said are helping to finance Islamic State. Using statistics published by the German Interior Ministry earlier this year, Breitbart London exposed how migrants were committing a disproportionate number of crimes compared to native Germans. Germany’s media meanwhile has attempted to pin a rise in crimes on   extremists. But statistics show that it is   violence and extremism that is on the rise in Germany, and that many fires in asylum homes often turn out to have been set by migrants themselves."

[The Austrian agency of Federal statistics report shows that during the period of 2004 to 2014 almost every other migrant had committed some kind of criminal offence after coming to the country and seeking asylum.  The majority of the crimes were perpetrated by Algerians, who have been held as responsible for many of the high profile migrant crimes like the mass sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve in Germany. Algerians commit a staggering 155 crimes per 100 asylum seekers, with Georgians close behind at 151 per 100, and Nigerians at 129 per 100, reports Kronen Zeitung. Syrians are presently reasonably low on the list at only around 8 offence per 100 applicants, but the Federal statistics agency says that because the study only covers up to 2014 it doesn’t account for the mass influx of Syrians experienced during 2015. The report also notes 80 per cent of the criminals were young men. While the overall proportion of all crime in Austria committed by what the report identifies as “asylum seekers” was reasonably low  —   around five per cent  —   during the period of the study they only actually made up less than half a per cent of Austria’s total population. This significant over representation in the crime statistics for this group will continue to give concern to Austrian police. Assuming the statistics are correct, one in every two migrants have been suspected of committing crimes. The study did not include whether charges were pressed upon the criminals or whether they were simply released. Criminology experts have said the cause of the high numbers is because of a “lack of prospects” for young migrant men in Austria. Many say the men take high risks coming to Europe and often find themselves indebted to people smugglers who often have ties to organised crime."

In the opening to his address, after accepting his party’s nomination, Trump turned to the subjects of crime, and law and order: I will present the facts plainly and honestly. We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore.   …     Homicides last year increased by 17% in America’s fifty largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. They are up nearly 60% in nearby Baltimore. In the President’s hometown of Chicago, more than 2, 000 have been the victims of shootings this year alone. And more than 3, 600 have been killed in the Chicago area since he took office. The number of police officers killed in the line of duty has risen by almost 50% compared to this point last year. Nearly 180, 000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens. Mehta griped: While the statistics he used were largely accurate, his conclusion was overreaching, according to independent fact checkers. While there have been sharp recent increases in homicide rates in certain parts of the country, overall murder rates are the lowest they have been in decades, according to factcheck. org. Additionally, a snapshot offered by looking at a couple years is insufficient to determine whether there is a new trend. In terms of specific statistics, Trump was accurate when he talked about a 17%    increase in homicides in the nation’s 50 largest cities and the murder rates in Washington, D. C. Baltimore and Chicago. But he was inaccurate when he said that the number of police officer deaths has risen nearly 50% compared to the same period last year. While the number of police officers killed by guns has gone up that amount, the overall number of police officers killed in the line of duty is flat. Note, in particular, Mahta’s last paragraph, in which she claims that Trump said “the number of police officer deaths has risen nearly 50%. ” Now look again at what Trump said: “killed in the line of duty. ” She corrects him for a mistake he never made.

31530,31538,50304,Police: Gay YouTuber Faked Hate Crime Attack on Himself - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,2016-06-29,2016.0,6.0,,"Popular homosexual YouTuber Calum McSwiggan reportedly faked an alleged hate crime attack on himself in West Hollywood on Monday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. [“Last night was the worst night of my life and I’m really struggling to find the words to talk about it. After one of the most wonderful weekends at VidCon we went out to a gay club to celebrate, and towards the end of the evening I was separated from my friends and beaten up by three guys,” claimed McSwiggan on his Instagram account, along with a picture showing him in a hospital.  “The authorities should have been there to help and protect me but instead they treated me like a second class citizen,” he claimed. “With three broken teeth and six stitches in my forehead, I’ve never felt so terrified to be a gay man in the public eye. All I can do is thank my wonderful friends @riyadhk, @melaniiemurphy and @douga_ for being with me the whole way. ” The post garnered thousands of likes and comments of support, however a different story was soon revealed. Captain Holly M. Perez of the West Hollywood Police Station claims that they “were unable to substantiate the assault” and that McSwiggan “had no visible injuries” at their time of investigation. Police soon arrested McSwiggan however after he was seen by deputies vandalizing a car, and the YouTuber ended up being processed with a mugshot and given a cell for the night. West Hollywood Police officers “then observed [McSwiggan] injuring himself with the handle and receiver to a payphone inside the cell. ” After breaking his teeth and piercing his forehead, McSwiggan was quickly sent to the local hospital. “Medical personnel were summoned and Mr. McSwiggan was transported to a local hospital for treatment,” claims the police statement. It was then that the YouTuber posted a picture of his injuries, whilst his mugshot shows him in a healthy and unharmed condition. “Mr. McSwiggan’s booking photo was taken prior to deputies seeing Mr. McSwiggan injuring himself,” reported the police station in a statement to The Advocate, confirming the captain’s claims that McSwiggan was unharmed at the time of his arrest. “I saw Cal screaming crying after the attack. He didn’t fake it,” wrote one of McSwiggan’s friends in a tweet, acknowledging that he didn’t witness the actual events. “I’ve been told to say nothing before court tomorrow but staying silent here is killing us. If you’re a friend just DM me for the truth,” announced McSwiggan on Twitter last night, before refusing to tweet anything else. Since the police statement has surfaced, McSwiggan has received hundreds of angry comments and replies from the public who have expressed disappointment in the YouTuber. “Shame on you for trying to victimize yourself for attention,” commented one user on the Instagram picture. “You are a very ill person and are in need of serious mental help. I hope you seek it out,” wrote another. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech and former editor of the Squid Magazine.

31712,31746,50512,"Chicago torture video: 4 charged with hate crimes, kidnapping",CNN,Holly Yan,2017-01-05,2017.0,1.0,," (CNN) Four suspects have been charged in connection with the attack on a   teen that was streamed on Facebook Live.  Jordan Hill, 18 Tesfaye Cooper 18 Brittany Covington, 18 and Tanishia Covington, 24, have each been charged with a hate crime, felony aggravated kidnapping, aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.  Hill, Cooper and Brittany Covington also face charges of residential burglary. Hill also faces charges of possession of a stolen motor vehicle.  Video of the torture has stunned the country, not just because of the graphic abuse, but because of the comments made by some of the assailants.  ”*F*ck Donald Trump!” one attacker shouted in the video. ”F*ck white people!” The  teen was tied up for four or five hours, Cmdr. Kevin Duffin of the Chicago Police Department told reporters. The victim will recover from his injuries and is at home with his parents, police said.  The teen’s    spoke briefly with reporters Thursday night. ”We’re so grateful for all the prayers and efforts that led to the safe return of our brother. We’re fully aware of the charges being brought against the offenders. At this time, we ask for continued prayers for all those involved, for our family’s privacy as we cope and heal,” David Boyd said, reading a statement. Boyd said the teen is doing as well as can be expected. He told the media that everyone in the family has seen the video, but he didn’t comment further on it.  Duffin said the department sought hate crime charges because of the victim’s diminished mental capacity, the fact that the four suspects tied him up and the racial epithets heard on the video. The victim apparently is white the suspects are  . The suspects will appear in court Friday. Facebook Live is changing our world    is that a good thing?  30 minutes of horror, Video of the attack shows the    victim cowering in a corner of a room, tied up with his mouth bound in plastic. His eyes exude fear as his attackers get ready for their next act.  One assailant slashes his sweatshirt with a knife. The young woman streaming the abuse on Facebook Live repeatedly turns the camera back to herself.  An attacker then takes a knife to the victim’s head, carving a patch off his scalp.  For the next 25 minutes, the abuse continues for the world to see. The victim is repeatedly kicked and punched, but his screams are apparently ignored.  The young woman broadcasting the attack appears dismayed that she’s not getting more attention online.  ”Y’all not even commenting on my s***,” she tells a friend during the live stream.  Debate over ’Black Lives Matter’ Many who saw the video have blamed the Black Lives Matter movement. Within 24 hours, the hashtag #BLMKidnapping was mentioned more than 480, 000 times on Twitter. But on Thursday, police said they have not seen any connection to the Black Lives Matter activist group, contrary to some reports on social media. Neither the Black Lives Matter national organization nor its Chicago chapter responded to CNN’s request for comment Thursday. But DeRay Mckesson, a prominent Black Lives Matter supporter, said those linking the attack to the movement don’t have their facts straight. ”It goes without saying that the actions being branded by the   as the ’BLM Kidnapping’ have nothing to do   the movement,” he tweeted. A former Chicago police officer, Dimitri Roberts, slammed the notion that the Black Lives Matter movement is to blame.  ”This is hate. And hate doesn’t have a color,” Roberts said. ”So for folks to talk about this is somehow connected to Black Lives Matter is absolutely the wrong way to look at this. . ..  And we cannot respond to hate with hate. It’s just going to perpetuate the cycle.”  President Barack Obama said the Facebook live torture video is ”despicable,” suggesting to CNN affiliate WBBM it was a hate crime. ”What we have seen as surfacing, I think, are a lot of problems that have been there a long time,” said Obama, a longtime resident of Chicago. ”Whether it’s tensions between police and communities, hate crimes of the despicable sort that has just now recently surfaced on Facebook.” ”The good news is that the next generation that’s coming behind us . .. have smarter, better, more thoughtful attitudes about race,” Obama said. What constitutes a hate crime, According to the city of Chicago’s website, ”Hate crimes are acts of bigotry, and are committed because of the intended victim’s actual or perceived ancestry, color, creed, gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability (including HIV status) or national origin. Hate crimes not only harm the victim, but also the group in which the targeted member belongs.” And according to Illinois law, hate can be considered an aggravating factor in a criminal charge and can result in a more severe sentence.  The fascinating, if unreliable, history of   tracking in the US, The assailants made a wide array of statements in the video, including repeated references to Donald Trump, white people in general and the victim’s appearance. How the encounter started, The victim’s parents reported him missing Monday, telling police they had not heard from their son since dropping him off Saturday at a McDonald’s in the Chicago suburb of Schaumburg, about 20 miles from their home in Crystal Lake. The victim was supposed to spend New Year’s Eve with Hill, who picked the teen up in a stolen van, Duffin said.  Hill drove the teen around for several days in the van    they apparently spent at least one night in the vehicle    before they went to the Covingtons’ apartment in Chicago. Police said Hill and the teen were acquaintances who knew each other from school.   At one point, Hill and the teen got into a play fight that escalated and he was tied up for hours, police said. A resident in another apartment complained about the noise and the two sisters went to the home and kicked down the door. The neighbor called 911.  Police responding to the call found the teen on the street wearing an   tank top, shorts and sandals. ”He was bloodied, he was battered,” Officer Michael Donnelly said. ”He was very discombobulated.” Video discovered, Police in Streamwood, which borders Schaumburg, said that after the man was reported missing to them, his parents began getting text messages from someone ”claiming to be holding him captive.”  Officers investigating the texts ”discovered a Facebook video depicting (the man) being verbally and physically abused.” It’s unclear what alerted the police to check Facebook. Soon after they discovered the video, Streamwood investigators said they were contacted by Chicago police, who said they had found the missing teen. After viewing the Facebook video, they determined the victim was the teen found on the street    and the people arrested were involved, police said. Video pulled from Facebook, Facebook said it pulled the original video from a suspect’s Facebook profile. ”We do not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook and have removed the original video for this reason. In many instances, though, when people share this type of content, they are doing so to condemn violence or raise awareness about it. In that case, the video would be allowed.”  ’Facebook Live’ torture video raises ethical questions for social media giant, According to its community standards, the company removes content, disables accounts and works with law enforcement in cases of a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.  Facebook users also can report offensive material to the social platform. If a live stream starts blowing up, Facebook staffers monitor it for possible violations and interrupt it if needed. "
31729,31766,50532,Facebook Live is the new key witness to crime,CNN,Danny Cevallos,2017-01-07,2017.0,1.0,," (CNN) The torture of a   teen that was streamed on Facebook Live has raised new questions about the use of social media platforms to spread videos glorifying abuse and humiliation.  This tragic incident might cause some to demand that social media companies such as Facebook do more to police and prevent this kind of content being posted by users.   That would be a mistake.   As a society interested in retributive justice, the last thing we want to do is point the finger at social media. Quite the contrary we should be thrilled that there are outlets like Facebook and Snapchat enticing criminals to post conclusive evidence of their own crimes.   Facebook agrees with me too, though, officially, their position is that they ”prohibit content deemed to be directly harmful. ..” and they ”work hard to remove hate speech quickly.”  What Facebook would really like to say is probably more like: ”Uh, our entire business model is premised on letting any one of our nearly two billion members post anything they want, anytime. What did you expect was going to happen?”   If you think social media platforms should be liable for the postings of others, that’s an understandable sentiment.  It’s just not the law in the United States.   The Communications Decency Act immunizes ”interactive computer services providers” such as Facebook from liability for what others post, even if the social media sites have been notified about damaging material and fail to remove it.  It’s nice that Facebook makes some effort to police these videos, but how could they do more? Social media can never 100% screen all content before it’s uploaded. Maybe in the future that kind of intelligent software will exist, but it doesn’t right now.    You know who else doesn’t want Facebook to do more to prevent these videos? Police and district attorneys. They love social media. I’ve seen it plenty of times in delinquency court. It’s a lot easier to prosecute a guns and drugs case against a juvenile when the juvenile’s own social media postings show him playing with . .. guns and drugs.   Detectives will tell you Facebook is often one of the first places they look for evidence. Sometimes, these cases would be completely unwinnable for the state if not for the defendant providing all the incriminating evidence against himself on social media.   This case in Chicago is a perfect example. So far, it seems that without Facebook Live there might never have been a criminal case to begin with. Even if this disabled victim had identified his assailants to police, if he was the sole eyewitness to this event, without the video, a defense attorney might have picked the victim apart on   and raised reasonable doubt. Instead, this video    produced and published by the defendants alone    will likely singlehandedly convict them, with the added bonus of giving a judge plenty of support for ”maxing them out” at sentencing, too.   On the other hand, there’s the argument that this crime might not have been committed in the first place if not for the allure of Facebook Live viral fame    but that’s a stretch. People have been abusing vulnerable populations for millennia, eons before Facebook and Snapchat.  At least now, social media yields evidence of these crimes, often supplied by the   criminals themselves. Social media shouldn’t aim to prevent disturbing videos like this from being posted. Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t anyway. When people post this kind of content, they only help law enforcement update their ”status” from citizen, to defendant and, ultimately, convicted criminal. And that deserves a big ”like.” "
32274,32402,51169,Violent crime in your city? More cops are not enough,CNN,,2017-01-16,2017.0,1.0,," (CNN) Violent crime, particularly gun violence, in the United States is a resurgent epidemic. While crime rates overall have fallen in the last two decades, violent crime in the United States began to climb again in 2015.  The national murder rate, projected to increase by 13. 1% this year, is driven by an increase in homicide numbers in a handful of cities    from Chicago to Baltimore to Tulsa    and we are seeing shocking and increasing rates of violence that will only get worse if our society doesn’t make a serious commitment to addressing it. But how?   Donald Trump argues that the country needs more ”law and order.” While law enforcement is crucial, the solution is far more complex. Our country needs a new social compact that integrates the education system, business leaders, philanthropists, communities and civic leaders into the strategy.  Many city leaders think they can solve this crisis by simply hiring hundreds more police officers. In reality, most cities need to put equal, if not more, resources into   law enforcement training programs. Officers should be better trained at   intense situations, having situational awareness and prioritizing threats. They need to build relationships and partnerships with the community and use all the tools law enforcement has at their disposal. Community policing has also been identified as an effective and worthwhile investment, but community policing means different things to different people and needs to be adopted with flexibility. Each community needs to define what it means to them and identify who needs to be engaged before persuading law enforcement to adopt new programs. From block captains to community activists, and anonymous texting options to ”beat meetings,”  programs should be tailored to the community and responsive to what it needs.  More robust programs that work directly with individuals who have committed crimes are needed to help prevent recidivism. About   of inmates released between   were arrested for a new crime within three years of release. In Philadelphia, where I was mayor, we launched Philly Rising (now known as SERVE Philadelphia) and RISE, and partnered with the Center for Returning Citizens, working immediately with the individuals on life plans and job opportunities after release to avoid recidivism.  CureViolence is another   program that trains previously incarcerated individuals to serve as ”interrupters” who help identify conflicts and high risk individuals in their own neighborhoods to mobilize the community to change norms.  To truly combat urban violence, however, we need a new commitment from all city leaders and stakeholders  —   business leaders, educators and researchers, philanthropists and public officials  —   not just law enforcement or the neighborhoods most immediately affected.  The best   tool is a job, and city leaders must engage businesses to support jobs and mentorship programs to youth drawn from the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Curriculum needs to be integrated throughout the education system from   so students are thinking of postsecondary education and careers at a younger age. Researchers and scholars can contribute by providing scientific and   policies to those designing these   programs, similar to the work of the University of Chicago’s Urban Labs.  And finally, the philanthropic community can pool together resources and invest long and deep on   policies, as the MacArthur Foundation, the Chicago Community Trust, and several other funders recently have to support the Chicago Fund for Safe and Peaceful Communities.  Moreover, these approaches can be tailored to any city, in the United States or abroad. Earlier this year, I participated in an action tour with leaders from some of the most violent cities in the world  —   Buenos Aires, Juarez, Medellin and São Paulo  —   to discuss how they were grappling with violence in their cities. From community leaders to police officers, researchers to returning citizens, everyone agreed that these approaches to a multilayered, complex strategy are more effective than just increased ”law and order.” Cities are on the rise. Luckily, they contain the answers to their own problems. As cities and society more broadly become increasingly diverse and dynamic, deliberate investments and interventions are needed to ensure future prosperity.  Every mayor is worried about keeping their cities safe and every resident wants secure and clean streets, walkable and   neighborhoods, parks and open space for children to play, a great education, and professional first responders. We all need to work together to shape this future. In this new year, let’s not leave it to ”law and order” alone and lose sight of our shared responsibility."
32280,32410,51177,Critics worried over Trump’s call to report crimes by undocumented immigrants,CNN,Tal Kopan,2017-01-28,2017.0,1.0,,"Washington (CNN) A   provision in President Donald Trump’s executive orders on immigration this week mandates reporting of crimes by undocumented immigrants    a policy that advocates are concerned could amount to propaganda against immigrants.  The provisions are nestled in Trump’s executive order on securing the nation’s interior.  One provision directs the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to create an ”Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens.” That office would offer services to victims of such crimes and to their family members, and would provide reports quarterly ”studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.” In a different section of the order, regarding sanctuary cities, the measure commissions a weekly report to publish a list of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants and to name and shame jurisdictions that ignored detention requests in relation to them. The goal is ”to better inform the public regarding the public safety threats associated with sanctuary jurisdictions.” But advocates for undocumented immigrants fear that the reporting is solely designed to skew public opinion.  ”The obvious intent of a provision like that is to provide a misleading view of what sanctuary jurisdictions are really doing,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.  Supporters of policies that offer leniency to undocumented immigrants who are otherwise upstanding members of society say that data shows that undocumented immigrants and immigrants in general commit crimes at a lower rate than the general population. One study from the American Immigration Council analyzed available data to find immigrants were less likely than   Americans to engage in criminal behavior, and a recent study by the Center for American Progress argues sanctuary cities enjoy lower crime and better economies than their   counterparts. Both organizations support   policies.  Trump made the victims of violent crime committed by undocumented immigrants a rallying cry throughout the campaign. He would frequently mention by name families like those of Kate Steinle, a young woman in San Francisco who was shot and killed allegedly by a repeat felon who had been deported numerous times.  Advocates of Trump’s approach say that the rate of crime among immigrants is irrelevant. ”The point is that every crime that is committed by someone who is here illegally is a crime that would not occur if they weren’t in the country,” said Hans von Spakovsky, a legal expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has been influential in advising the Trump administration.  Von Spakovsky said the provisions are merited for the sake of data.  ”I think that’s a very important piece of transparency,” von Spakovsky said. ”That is something that those in favor of illegal immigration have long tried to ignore and cover up. They don’t want the public to know about the Kate Steinles of the world who have been killed by illegal aliens, who were released by sanctuary cities instead of being given to the feds to deport.” Still, Jadwat argues that focusing specifically on crimes ignores the good that undocumented immigrants can do in their communities.  ”The truth is that there are undocumented immigrants all over our country in all of our communities who are working to make everyone safer, to increase the wealth in their communities, who are part of the civic fabric, who have family members who are US citizens, who are key contributors to the health of our communities, and what publishing a list like this is trying to do is to ignore those facts and ignore the reasons why mayors and police chiefs and sheriffs around the country have made the decision to do what’s best for their communities in a constitutional fashion,” Jadwat said.  Washington University law professor Stephen Legomsky called the quarterly victimization reports ”problematic,” saying its goal seems to be painting an image of undocumented immigrants in the public’s mind, despite evidence of lower crime rates.  But he also said the measure would likely survive constitutional challenge. Unlike, for example, mandating similar crime reporting for a particular race, the courts give federal officials latitude to make decisions about immigration policy.  ”I think any information that is arguably relevant to immigration policy discussions is probably fair game,” Legomsky said. ”The government is allowed to do things to noncitizens that it isn’t allowed to do to citizens.” A former ICE acting director under former President Barack Obama said whether the reporting is legitimate depends on its effects and desired effects.  ”The more data that’s known about the undocumented population the better,” said John Sandweg, now at a private crisis management firm. ”I certainly wouldn’t limit it to crimes being committed.” He said if a criminal is released, it makes sense for communities to be aware.  ”There is a role to play to make sure we know when serious criminals know are handed over I don’t think it’s a problem to notify community members if people are released,” Sandweg said. ”To the extent it’s turned into propaganda to feed this narrative, which has been proven false, that undocumenteds commit crimes at higher rates, that’s a poor use of resources.”"
32546,32725,51492,Trump signs three new executive orders on crime reduction,CNN,Laura Jarrett,2017-02-09,2017.0,2.0,,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump signed three new executive orders Thursday that he said are ”designed to restore safety in America.” Trump signed the executive orders in the Oval Office after swearing in Attorney General Jeff Sessions. One of the orders, aimed at ”reduc( ing) crime and restor( ing) public safety,” directs Sessions to establish a new Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety. The Task Force will develop ”strategies to reduce crime, including, in particular, illegal immigration, drug trafficking and violent crime,” propose new legislation, and submit at least one report to the President within the next year. A second executive order, aimed at combating transnational drug cartels, prescribes steps for various federal agencies to ”increase intelligence” sharing among law enforcement partners. The order also instructs an existing   working group to submit a report to Trump within four months detailing the progress made in combating criminal organizations, ”along with any recommended actions for dismantling them.” ”I’m directing Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security to undertake all necessary and lawful action to break the back of the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation and are destroying the blood of our youth and other people,” Trump said Thursday. Finally, Trump signed an executive order directing the Justice Department to use existing federal law to prosecute those who commit crimes against law enforcement officers.  ”It’s a shame what’s been happening to our great, truly great law enforcement officers,” Trump said at the signing ceremony. ”That’s going to stop as of today.”  Amnesty International USA swiftly reacted to the executive order, saying that while ”(l) aw enforcement officers face unique hardships and challenges due to the nature of their work,” this order does not address underlying problems in the criminal justice system. ”This order will not protect anyone, and instead it creates additional penalties that could cause people to be significantly   for offenses including resisting arrest,” Amnesty International’s Noor Mir said in a statement.

32901,33148,51961,Are undocumented immigrants committing a crime? Not necessarily ,CNN,Laura Jarrett,2017-02-25,2017.0,2.0,,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump says he plans to crack down on illegal immigration.  But what exactly does ”illegal” mean in this context?  Under federal law, it is a crime for anyone to enter into the US without the approval of an immigration officer    it’s a misdemeanor offense that carries fines and no more than six months in prison.  Many foreign nationals, however, enter the country legally every day on valid work or travel visas, and end up overstaying for a variety of reasons.  But that’s not a violation of federal criminal law    it’s a civil violation that gets handled in immigration court proceedings.  In fact, a 2006 study showed that roughly 45% of undocumented immigrants originally entered the US legally, but then remained in the country without authorization after their visas had expired. The penalty for this type of violation of immigration law is deportation, and according to the ACLU, ”civil removal proceedings far outnumber criminal prosecutions and remain the primary manner in which the federal authorities enforce the immigration laws.” If, however, an undocumented immigrant is deported and then returns to the US without permission, then that ”illegal  ” constitutes a federal offense with different tiers of accompanying prison time. While Trump has often focused on immigrants who commit violent felonies while in the US, studies show those are actually the exception    immigrant crime rates in several instances are actually lower than native   populations (with some exceptions).  So although there are more than 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the US, they haven’t all committed a crime just by being in the country."
32905,33152,51965,Kansas shooting: Widow of Indian man calls for hate crime action,CNN,,2017-02-24,2017.0,2.0,," (CNN) The widow of an Indian man killed in a Kansas bar said she was constantly worried about violence against foreigners in the United States, but her husband had assured her everything would be OK.  ”I told him many a times, ’Should we think about going back? Should we think about going to a different country?’ He said, ’No,’ ” Sunayana Dumala said, according to video recorded by CNN affiliate  . Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, died Wednesday after he was shot at a bar in Olathe, where he was having an   beer with a friend. Hours later, police arrested Adam W. Purinton about 70 miles away     in Clinton, Missouri.  Purinton, 51, also is accused of shooting two other people. He was charged with one count of premeditated   murder and two counts of attempted premeditated   murder.  The victim’s friend, Alok Madasani, 32, and bar patron Ian Grillot, 24, suffered injuries, authorities said. The FBI has joined the investigation to determine whether the shootings are federal hate crimes. Authorities said the suspect’s alleged motive is still being investigated. Dumala called for Washington to do something about hate crimes.  ”I need an answer, I need an answer from the government. I need an answer for everyone out there,” she said. ”Not just for my husband . .. but for everyone, all those people of any race.” Originally from India, Kuchibhotla was an engineer at Garmin, the GPS  . Madasani was also an Indian native and worked for Garmin. Victim remembered at vigil, The Olathe community mourned Kuchibhotla’s death during a candlelight vigil Friday night at a church just steps from where he was gunned down. At the time of Wednesday’s shooting children were drawing with sidewalk chalk outside the First Baptist Church of Olathe when they heard gunshots, CNN affiliate   reported. Days later community members gathered at the church to comfort each other.  ”As a community we are shocked, we are saddened, we are devastated,” Olathe Mayor Michael Copeland said, WDAF reported. Laura Gilman of Jewish Family Services of Greater Kansas City was on hand to offer comfort. She helped counsel community members after deadly shootings at a Jewish Community Center in nearby Overland Park in 2014, WDAF said. ”Unfortunately we know what it’s like to be victims of a hate crime, so we want the Olathe community to know, the minority community to know, that we are with them,” Gilman told the TV station. The Indian Association of Kansas City is planning a vigil of its own Sunday evening.  ”It takes a long time for us to get out of this shock that the community has been in, because nothing like this has happened here before,” Sridhar Harohalli, the group’s president, told WDAF. What happened? The incident started after the suspect became agitated at the bar, where patrons were watching a basketball game, Grillot said.  Witnesses told local media they heard the suspect yell, ”Get out of my country.”  Police have not corroborated the statements.  ”I opened the door and was like, ’I’m going to have to ask you to leave, sir. There’s no reason to act like that around this bar. This is a family restaurant,’” Grillot told CNN affiliate  .  A witness told CNN the suspect asked Grillot: ”Why are you standing up for them?” Jeremy Luby said the man emphasized ”them,” as if it were a derogatory term.  Luby said the man stumbled around the parking lot for a while, then got in a pickup and left. The suspect returned and started firing, he said.  ”I thought all the trouble was over with, and we were all just sitting and watching the game minding our own business,” Grillot told the affiliate.  Grillot was shot in the hand and chest as he tried to stop the gunman.  ”I thought his magazine was empty. So I got up and started chasing him down. I tried to subdue him so that police could come in and do what they needed to do, and I guess I miscounted with everything going on. I got behind him. And he turned around and fired a round at me,” he told the affiliate.  The suspect ran away as police closed in, The Kansas City Star reported.  Police provided first aid to the three men until paramedics arrived and took them to the hospital, where Kuchibhotla died, Olathe police said.  Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted that Madasani has been released from the hospital. Grillot is still hospitalized.  A GoFundMe page, posted by his sister Maggie Grillot, has raised more than $300, 000 for his medical bills.  A search for motive, Nearly six hours after the shootings, Purinton was arrested at a bar in Missouri, the Star reported. He was extradited to Johnson County, Kansas, on Friday and is due in court on Monday afternoon. Thousands of miles away in India, officials expressed shock at the shootings. ”My heartfelt condolences to bereaved family,” Swaraj, the external affairs minister, tweeted. ”I have assured all help and assistance to the family.”  India sent two embassy officials to Kansas to help arrange for the transportation of Kuchibhotla’s remains.

33037,33298,52111,Trump’s condemnation of hate crimes doesn’t go nearly far enough,CNN,,2017-03-01,2017.0,3.0,," (CNN) President Trump’s speech to Congress on Tuesday began with references to the threats against Jewish community centers and last week’s violence targeting two   engineers in Olathe, Kansas, which is being investigated as a hate crime.  While important, President Trump’s statement provides little consolation to communities facing backlash and criminalization in America today. A few words of condemnation cannot erase months of President Trump’s own divisive rhetoric and his administration’s   policies targeting and stigmatizing the very communities most vulnerable to hate violence. The two   engineers came face to face with the type of bigotry that has emerged since President Trump’s election. Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani were dining at Austin’s Bar and Grill when, witnesses said, a    white man, Adam W. Purinton, questioned the men about their immigration status and yelled ”Get out of my country.” After being kicked out of the bar, police say Purinton came back and began shooting at Kuchibhotla and Madasani. Kuchibhotla died from his wounds. Madasani and Ian Grillot, a bystander who stepped in to help, remain in critical condition. Sadly, this form of hate violence is far too common. Since the presidential election, organizations have documented upticks in reports of bias and harassment of immigrants and Muslim, Sikh, Hindu, Arab and South Asian communities. President Trump’s criminalization policies that target immigrants, Muslims and people of color through bans, walls and raids have only exacerbated this climate. The administration’s actions send a clear message to the public: Certain people do not belong in America. Given this context, it is not surprising that reports of harassment and discrimination at Jewish community centers, homes and mosques continue to rise. Unless this pattern of   hostility toward communities of color, Muslims, and immigrants radically changes, condemnations of hate violence can only go so far. And   in particular should demand more than words from the administration. From my work with South Asian communities experiencing hate violence before and after   I understand how meaningful it is to receive attention from   officials in the wake of tragedy. After the hate massacre at a Sikh house of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, in 2012, President Obama’s quick response, Attorney General Eric Holder’s remarks at the memorial service, and first lady Michelle Obama’s meeting with family members all conveyed an important message: We see you and we feel your pain. But Oak Creek families, community members, and national organizations did not stop there. We pressed for changes in federal hate crime data collection and called for interagency task forces to address the ongoing threat of post   backlash. Similarly,   must now double down on our commitment to address not only hate violence but also the broader policies of the Trump administration. This is not the time for   or any community of color to remain on the sidelines or take refuge in the notion that ”model minority” status will inoculate us from racism. The idea that educational and economic privilege or ”legal” immigration status can prevent discrimination has never served us. Think back to the turn of the 20th century when Sikh and Hindu lumber mill workers were chased out of Bellingham, Washington, or to the harassment faced by   residents and small businesses from a group calling itself the ”Dotbusters” or to the post   targeting of Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus across the socioeconomic spectrum in airports, workplaces and schools. No, degrees and bank accounts have never saved us. What we must do is connect deeply with other communities of color, critically analyze government policies, and be ready to confront Islamophobia,   bias and   racism, both within and outside our communities.  That means challenging Trump’s proposed ”Combating Islamic Extremism” program that will further stigmatize American Muslims and lead to the surveillance of Muslim youth and Muslim organizations. It means raising our voices against the administration’s ”law and order” framework that targets black people and strips away civil rights protections. It means supporting undocumented people subjected to raids just as robustly as standing by Indian   workers likely to be harmed by Trump’s forthcoming executive order. While   stake our claims of belonging from Oak Creek to Olathe, this struggle against hatred and bigotry is not ours alone to bear. Our local and national elected leaders must decide whether they are comfortable with making statements calling for tolerance in response to every act of hate that occurs,  or if they will take political risks to eliminate   and institutional racism.  Industries that employ immigrants and people of color must become more active in civic society and raise their voices against discriminatory policies that affect their employees and families, as many technology companies did in response to the Muslim ban.  All Americans must play a role, whether this means intervening when peers use racist and xenophobic language, reaching out to neighbors and   from different backgrounds, or demanding inclusive and equitable policies from school boards and city councils. These are the actions that will go much further than mere words to curb hate violence. To counter the scourge of American backlash, we must continue to demand that our government aligns its actions with its words    and that starts with respecting people in all of their humanity."
33143,33421,52234,Sikh man’s shooting in Washington investigated as hate crime,CNN,,2017-03-05,2017.0,3.0,," (CNN) The shooting victim seemed like most of his other neighbors, except that he wore a turban and beard.  And it was those hallmarks of his Sikh faith that apparently led another man to confront him in his driveway, tell him to ”go back to your country” and shoot him in the arm.  Police are searching for the gunman and investigating the shooting in Kent, Washington, as a possible hate crime, CNN affiliate KIRO reported.  The victim is a US citizen, originally from India’s Punjab province,    Sikh community leader Jasmit Singh told CNN.   Singh said the man’s family told him that he was in his driveway Friday when the other man approached, asking something along the lines of ”why are you cleaning your car?” The conversation became heated and the man threatened the victim, called him names, pushed him to the ground and pulled out a gun. The victim lost consciousness, only realizing he had been shot when he regained consciousness, Singh said. He was discharged from the hospital Saturday and doctors expected him to make a complete recovery, Singh said. Sikhs have been victims of   hate crimes, Police respond, ”We’re early on in our investigation and the shot resulted in non   injuries, however we are treating this as a very serious incident,” Kent police chief Ken Thomas said in a news conference broadcast by KIRO.  Thomas said police were investigating the shooting as a possible hate crime, KIRO reported. ”To think that this could happen in our community was very surprising and extremely disappointing,” Thomas said. ”This is the first incident of this magnitude that I’m aware of in the city of Kent.  The FBI’s Seattle office said it was investigating alongside Kent police. ”The FBI remains committed​ to investigating c​rimes that are potentially   and we continue to work with all our community partners in the Seattle area,” a spokesperson said in a statement. India reacts, India’s Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj, tweeted that she was sorry to hear of the attack.  Swaraj said she had spoken to the victim’s father, who told her his son had suffered a bullet injury to the arm and was ”out of danger” and recovering in a private hospital. India’s Foreign Ministry said it was in touch with local authorities and had offered assistance. ”What we heard from the victim himself is that the shooter asked him when are you going back to your own country?” spokesman Gopal Baglay said.  MaryKay Loss Carlson, the top diplomat at the US Embassy in New Delhi, tweeted her thoughts as well. ”Saddened by shooting in WA. Wishes for a quick and full recovery.  As @POTUS said we condemn ”hate and evil in all its forms,” she said.  Witness to attack, A tenant at the property where the shooting took place told  KIRO she witnessed her landlord being shot before the gunman ran away. ”The guy told him to go back home,” Susan Livie told the station.  The Sikh Coalition said members of its community are at heightened risk of   attacks    partially because their faith requires the wearing of turbans and beards. In a statement, spokesman Rajdeep Singh said it’s important the Kent shooting be investigated as a hate crime. ”While we appreciate the efforts of state and local officials to respond to attacks like this, we need our national leaders to make hate crime prevention a top priority,” he said. ”Tone matters in our political discourse, because this a matter of life or death for millions of Americans who are worried about losing loved ones to hate.” The coalition said the Kent attack had similarities with the shooting of two Indian immigrants in Kansas in February. Violence against minorities has increased since the presidential election and hate crimes need to be identified as such, it said.  Stigma of racism ’erased’ ”Investigating this as an   hate crime is critical, because without our government agencies recognizing hatred for what it is, we can’t combat the problem,” Jasmit Singh said. ”The Sikh community is shaken and very frustrated at the hate and rhetoric that is being spread today about anyone that looks different, who looks like an immigrant.” Jasmit Singh said approximately 50, 000 Sikhs lived in Washington    some 30, 000 of them in the   area. ”Based on anecdotal evidence, more and more people are saying inappropriate things to Sikh men, the stigma attached to being a racist has been erased from the community,” he said. Rep. Ami Bera, the longest currently serving   member of Congress, on Sunday denounced the attack. ”This disturbing crime is an outrage that goes against everything we stand for as a nation of immigrants,” Bera said in a statement. ”Xenophobia and racism have no place in America, and we as a nation need to stand up to these hate crimes    starting with the President.” Jasmit Singh also said the White House needs to speak out against racism and bigotry. ”In the past    in Bush, Obama time    there was swift action and communication saying that this is unacceptable,” he said. ”We aren’t seeing any response from this administration.” But the Kent Police Department and City Council have provided a lot of feedback and met with the community, he said."
33187,33470,52283,Sikhs: Religious minority target of hate crimes,CNN,,2017-03-06,2017.0,3.0,,"New Delhi (CNN) The victim of a possible hate crime in Washington state Friday would not be the first Sikh to be targeted. Since     groups say members of their religion have faced discrimination and abuse because their long beards and turbans make them more visible than other minority groups.  According to the FBI,   hate crimes in the US surged 67% last year, to levels not seen since 2001.    Highly visible, In a statement, the Sikh Coalition, America’s largest Sikh civil rights group, said that Sikhs are often targeted for hate crimes in part ”due to the Sikh articles of faith, including a turban and beard, which represent the Sikh religious commitment to justice, tolerance and equality.” In 1699, Guru Gobind Singh commanded all Sikhs to wear the ”Five Ks” in order to identify themselves as a member of the Khalsa Panth, an army of the devout.  The ”Five Ks” are: Kesh (uncut hair) Kara (a steel bangle) Kanga (a wooden comb) Kaccha (cotton underwear) and Kirpan (a steel sword).  Devout Sikh men don’t cut their hair or shave because they believe you must maintain your body in the way that God created you. Turbans are worn as a way to keep heads covered out of respect when in public and in religious spaces.  Sikh women often cover their heads with a long scarf called a chunni or dupatta.  Hate crime, In the first month following   the Sikh Coalition documented more than 300 cases of violence and discrimination against Sikhs in the US.  Last year, multiple Sikhs told CNN that they felt no safer, 15 years after the terrorist attacks.  ”The threat of hate and racism has become a part of our daily lives,” lawyer and activist Valarie Kaur said.  In 2012 a gunman walked into a gurdwara, a Sikh place of worship, in Wisconsin and killed six people.  Sikhs have also been subject to racial profiling outside the US. Last year, designer and actor Waris Ahluwalia spoke out after he was prevented from boarding an airplane in Mexico by local security agents after he refused to remove his turban during a security screening.  Ahluwalia said Aeromexico staff and security screeners told him to buy a ticket for a different carrier after he refused to remove his turban. ”I was upset, I had anxiety, I was shaking, I did not speak. And then I realized, clearly, they have not been trained properly. I knew yelling will not do anything. It is about education and the policy,” Ahluwalia told CNN at the time. Climate of fear, According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate crime, there has been an uptick of incidents targeting Muslims and other religious minority groups since the election of President Donald Trump.  While the White House condemned the recent shooting of two Indian men as ”an act of racially motivated hatred,” some commentators have blamed Trump for not doing enough.  During his first address to Congress last week, Trump said the violence was a reminder that ”while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its very ugly forms.” But it’s not enough for some.  ”A few words of condemnation cannot erase months of President Trump’s own divisive rhetoric and his administration’s policies targeting and stigmatizing the very communities most vulnerable to hate violence,” civil rights lawyer Deepa Iyer wrote last week for CNN Opinion.    leaders have called on the President to address the attack in Washington, while others have warned that his words may lead to violence.  ”What (Trump) says goes short of being defined as hate, but in the hearts and minds of the lay person is translated as hate,” Mejindarpal Kaur, international legal director of global advocacy organization United Sikhs, told CNN.  ”They’ve targeted their hate toward anyone who looks Middle Eastern.”"
33579,34020,52836,10 charged in alleged mafia crime wave,CNN,,2017-03-28,2017.0,3.0,," (CNN) Ten alleged members of the Bonanno mafia family have been charged with racketeering and related crimes, according to a   indictment unsealed Tuesday. The charges stem from what prosecutors claim was almost 20 years of organized criminal activity in and around Queens    including participation in gun battles, beatings, extortion, and arson. ”The Mafia hasn’t stopped operating and the crimes these members are charged with today prove that,” the FBI’s William Sweeny Jr. said in a statement.  The 10 defendants    Ronald ”Ronnie G.” Giallanzo, Michael Padavona, Nicholas ”Pudgie” Festa, Michael Palmaccio, Christopher ”Bald Chris” Boothby, Evan ”The Jew” Greenberg, Richard Heck, Michael Hintze, Robert Pisani and Robert ”Chippy” Tanico    were arrested Tuesday and arraigned in federal court in Brooklyn. Prosecutors: Vendetta prompted shootouts, Giallanzo, identified by the Department of Justice as an acting captain in the Bonnano family, stands at the center of the alleged crime wave. A reputed Bonanno soldier for nearly two decades, Giallanzo used the proceeds from fraudulent stock market schemes to fund a   business with more than $3 million, court documents state.  In the course of running his   operation    and while awaiting trial for securities fraud    prosecutors claim Giallanzo ordered members of his crew, including Palmaccio and Padavona, to kill a suspected rival in the Howard Beach section of Queens.  The man was believed by Giallanzo to have been behind multiple robberies of Festa’s   and   operation, court papers state. The vendetta resulted in at least four shootouts in Howard Beach over a   period, according to prosecutors. Defendants could face up to 20 years in prison, Giallanzo pleaded guilty to charges of securities fraud and was sentenced in 2007 to more than seven years in prison. Prosecutors allege, however, that he continued to run his   operation from behind bars, instructing his associates to beat up borrowers who were in arrears. When conditionally released in April 2013, Giallanzo took a personal role in the shakedowns, prosecutors contend. He allegedly beat someone who owed $250, 000 until the man ”soiled himself,” court documents state.  He also met with several ranking members of the Bonanno crime family in violation of the conditions of his release. Those meetings earned him another stretch in prison, from March until December 2016. Elizabeth Macedonio, Giallanzo’s attorney, could not be immediately reached for comment Tuesday. If found guilty of racketeering or loan sharking, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison. "
33768,34265,53081,Hate crimes focal point of new DOJ task force,CNN,Laura Jarrett,2017-04-06,2017.0,4.0,," (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions provided an update on the Justice Department’s new crime reduction task force Wednesday, including new details on a subcommittee that will specifically focus on hate crime prevention. In a letter to US Attorney’s offices across the country, Sessions explained that the Hate Crimes Subcommittee ”will develop a plan to appropriately address hate crimes to better protect the rights of all Americans.” ”We must also protect the civil rights of all Americans, and we will not tolerate threats or acts of violence targeting any person or community in this country on the basis of their religious beliefs or background,” Sessions added. On Monday a group of 13 Democratic senators called on the President to establish a task force on combating   violence and on Wednesday evening, the senate unanimously passed a bipartisan resolution condemning racial, religious and ethnic hate crimes. Last year the FBI released statistics showing an alarming spike in the number of reported hate crimes    in particular a 67% increase in crimes against Muslim Americans. The new announcement is particularly noteworthy in light of Sessions’ previous opposition to the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009 when Sessions was a US senator. ”The hate crimes amendment is unwarranted, possibly unconstitutional    certainly, I believe it is unconstitutional in certain parts    and it violates the basic principle of equal justice under the law,” Sessions said back in 2009 on the Senate floor. ”The hate crimes amendment to this bill has been said to cheapen the civil rights movement.” Despite Sessions’ reservations about the law as a senator, he said during his confirmation hearing: ”The law has been passed, Congress has spoken, you can be sure that I will enforce it.”  In addition to hate crimes, the DOJ task force will also undertake a review of the department’s existing marijuana enforcement policy    a subject that legalization advocates have been watching closely given Sessions’ fervent disapproval of the drug. ”I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store,” Sessions said last month. ”Educating people and telling them the terrible truth about drugs and addiction will result in better choices. We can reduce the use of drugs, save lives and turn back the surge in crime that inevitably follows in the wake of increased drug abuse.”"
33791,34289,53105,The new weapon against hate crime,CNN,,2017-02-24,2017.0,2.0,,"Seattle (CNN) Two years ago, Seattle Police Officer Jim Ritter realized his city had a major problem. People weren’t reporting hate crimes. Watch ”New Day” and ”CNN Newsroom” each Friday to see inspiring stories of officers going above and beyond the call of duty. He’d hear about them, anecdotally. Some were horrifying incidents. But they weren’t showing up on police reports. ”After determining most of these crimes were being committed in the commercial districts throughout the city, (I) had to sit down and figure out what are we going to do about this,” Ritter said. He started a program called Safe Place. It’s a     initiative that designates local businesses as a place where victims of hate crimes can shelter while waiting for the police to arrive. It’s a simple concept based on something he remembered from his childhood    houses with stickers that signaled to kids walking to school that if something bad happened, they could knock on the door and get help. Ritter designed a sticker    a police shield with the LGBT rainbow symbolism. It goes on the front of any business agreeing to call police if a victim of a hate crime comes inside looking for help. ”In this day of communications, everybody just assumes someone else is calling police and we can’t afford to have that happen anymore, neither can these victims,” Ritter said. Ritter, who is gay, admitted that he never knew so much   crime was going unreported in his own city, where he’d worked as a cop for nearly four decades. ’We don’t want to screw this up’ Now, Safe Place has become so popular, he can barely think about anything else. Police departments across the country are calling, asking for help implementing his program in Cincinnati, Louisville, Birmingham, Durham, Baltimore, Honolulu, Columbus    and even in Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia. Most notably, the Orlando police launched Safe Place on the   anniversary of the Pulse Night Club massacre. ”I actually feel like I’m making a positive difference in society and not just going through the motions,” Ritter said. ”I think the majority of police chiefs and administrators that contacted me said, ” Hey, Jim, we want to get this right, we don’t want to screw this up.” He’s even working with the Department of Justice. ”You’ve got victims from all different kinds of minority communities that have the same thing happen to them. They are assaulted or victimized either because of who they are or who these suspects portray them to be.” Here in Seattle, Ritter said two felony assault cases were reported from inside a Safe Place business within the program’s first week. ”One of those safe place locations, the witnesses were holding a suspect down when police arrived,” he said. And police immediately noticed an increase in the reporting of hate crimes. ”And that told me that it was starting to work as designed,” he said. A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center says that hate groups are on the rise, and crimes against members of the LGBT community are up from last year. ’You better watch your back’ Aaron Amundsen is one of the victims targeted right after the election in November. He’s a Seattle tattoo parlor owner, and he walked out to his car one day to find a wet, wrinkled up note. ”I opened it up and thought: Is this a joke? And then it hit me, and I got really upset by it,” he said. ”It was: ’Hey blank, we won so you better watch your back.’ Just a bunch of political and anti LGBTQ slurs. And it was kind of threatening and really spooky.” The note said, ”Your days are numbered. Make America straight again to make it great again. You will see.” It included two gay slurs. ’Standing up for what’s right’ Amundsen didn’t report the incident right away. But his business partner posted it to Facebook, where it got a lot of attention. Ritter noticed it and encouraged Amundsen to file a police report. He did, and says he’s glad that he filed it, even if no one is ever caught. ”It’s about standing up for what’s right,” Amundsen said. But Ritter said he’s having to have fewer and fewer conversations like that one    encouraging reluctant victims to report hate crimes. And that’s, in part, thanks to the awareness that Safe Place brought to Seattle. ”I’ve always known that the majority of the community is for the most part fundamentally fair and they want to do the right thing,” Ritter said. ”I think the Safe Place initiative has caused the conversation to start where they can verbally acknowledge that, and feel comfortable about talking about topics which they really haven’t had the opportunity to talk about in the past.”"
34674,35345,54166,Hate crime: Man sentenced for killing transgender woman,CNN,,2017-05-15,2017.0,5.0,," (CNN) A Mississippi man was sentenced to 49 years in prison Monday and fined $20, 000 for killing his   because she was transgender, the US Justice Department said. Joshua Vallum, 29, of Lucedale is the first person prosecuted for a federal hate crime in which the victim was targeted for being transgender, the Justice Department said in a news release. Vallum knew Mercedes Williamson was a transgender teenage girl when they began dating, but kept her gender identity secret, prosecutors said.  They broke up in 2014 but Vallum decided to kill her in May 2015 because a friend had discovered she was transgender, the Justice Department said. Vallum, a member of the Almighty Latin Kings and Queens Nation crime gang, feared reprisals from gang members if they found out about the relationship, the Justice Department said. Transgender hate crime guilty plea in federal court a first, After luring the    into his car under false pretenses, he assaulted her and stabbed her with a pocket knife, prosecutors said. As she tried to flee he stabbed her repeatedly and used a hammer to deliver deadly blows, the Justice Department said. Vallum initially claimed he killed Williamson in a panic after learning she was transgender.  In his guilty plea to the hate crime on December 21, he admitted to lying about the circumstances surrounding her death. He would not have killed Williamson if she was not transgender, he said. Vallum had previously pleaded guilty in state court to murder charges in George County, Mississippi, and was sentenced to life in prison.  Because Mississippi does not have a statute that protects people from bias crimes based on gender identity, the federal government was able to bring federal hate crime charges.  ”Today’s sentencing reflects the importance of holding individuals accountable when they commit violent acts against transgender individuals,”  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said.  ”The Justice Department will continue its efforts to vindicate the rights of those individuals who are affected by bias motivated crimes.”  A federal law    the Matthew Shepard, James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act    criminalizes violence based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity. The US attorney’s office for the Southern District of Mississippi prosecuted the hate crime."
35129,35859,54682,The four reasons people commit hate crimes,CNN,Daniel Burke,2017-06-02,2017.0,6.0,," (CNN) What motivated the man who killed two people on a Portland train after shouting   slurs?  What prompted the person, or people, who   the   on an NBA star’s home?  What ideas would incite an Israeli teen charged with threatening dozens of Jewish centers in the US, throwing communities into chaos and terrifying the parents of young children?  We call them all ”hate crimes,” as if the same motivation lurks behind each of these disparate incidents. But that term is outdated and inaccurate, experts say.  What spurs offenders into action is rarely animosity alone. It’s a toxic mix of emotions, from anger to fear to indignation. And, as the FBI says, ”hate itself is not a crime.” Instead, bias is considered an ”added element” to offenses like murder, arson and vandalism, leading at times to longer prison sentences.  The public and prosecutors often disagree on what constitutes a hate crime. Besieged minorities like Muslims and transgender people often see an assault on one of them as an attack on their entire community, especially in this era of intense rancor and fear. Between the November election and February, for instance, the Southern Poverty Law Center counted more than 1, 300 ”hate incidents” across the country.  But how do prosecutors determine the role hate had in a given crime? For more than two decades, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies have relied on a somewhat obscure study to help spot bias in criminal offenses. In 1993, Jack McDevitt and Jack Levin, two social scientists in Boston, examined 169   case files at the Boston Police Department. They then interviewed victims, offenders and investigators. McDevitt and Levin found that there are four main kinds of hate crimes, ranging from   the most common to ”” the rare but often lethal hardcore hatemongers.    Knowing the differences between the types of hate crimes    and their motivations    not only helps law enforcement better understand them, McDevitt said, it also helps find perpetrators and put them in prison. ”If they know the motivation,” he told CNN, ”they know where to look.”  Here are the four categories of   along with some examples, many of which are hypotheticals taken from the FBI’s training manual on recognizing and collecting data on hate crimes:    These hate crimes are often driven by an immature itch for excitement and drama. Think bored and drunk young men marauding through neighborhoods, mayhem on their minds.  Often there is no real reason for these crimes, experts say. They’re committed for the thrill of it, and the victims are vulnerable simply because their sexual, racial, ethnic, gender or religious background differs from that of their attackers.  Often the attackers think society doesn’t care about the victims    or worse, will applaud their assault.   The attackers may be young, but they are dangerous. In McDevitt’s study, 70% of these ”thrill offenses” were assaults, including vicious beatings that put victims in the hospital. That said, the attackers’ animosity toward their victims, who are chosen at random, can be relatively low, which at least offers the opportunity for rehabilitation.  Examples: A group of teens breaks into an LGBT center, destroys property and scrawls   graffiti on the walls. A street gang assaults a Hindu man while yelling   epithets. A group of men viciously attack men leaving a   gay bar, yelling ”Sissy!” and ” !”    Defensive  In these hate crimes, the attackers sees themselves as ”defending” their turf: their neighborhood, their workplace, their religion or their country.  Unlike   who invade other neighborhoods and attack without warning, ”defenders” target specific victims and justify their crimes as necessary to keep threats at bay.  Many times, they are triggered by a particular event, such as a Muslim or black family moving into a new neighborhood.  Like   the ”defenders” show little or no remorse for their attacks and believe that most, if not all of society supports them but is too afraid to act.   ”They honestly believe that what they’re doing has some sort of communal assent,” said Brian Levin, who leads the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino.  Examples: A group home for people with psychiatric disabilities is set on fire by a man heard to say, ”I’ll get rid of those crazies.” A transgender woman is attacked near her home by men who yell, ”We don’t want no queers in this neighborhood!” A Japanese man is attacked by a white man who called him an   epithet and complained that the Japanese are taking jobs away from Americans.  Retaliatory, These hate crimes are often seen as revenge, whether in response to personal slights, other hate crimes or terrorism.  The ”avengers,” who often act alone, target members of the racial, ethnic or religious group who they believe committed the original crime    even if the victims had nothing to do with it. They care only about revenge, and they will travel to the victims’ territory to enact it.  These     attacks spike after acts of terrorism, a bitter backlash that often targets Muslim Americans. After the   attacks, for example, hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims rose by 1, 600%. A similar spike occurred after the Paris attacks in 2015.  Occasionally, members of the same religion or racial group target each other.  Ohio prosecutors, for example, charged members of a breakaway Amish sect with hate crimes after they violently cut off the beards of a rival sect. An appeals court overturned the hate crimes conviction, though, ruling that religion had been a significant but not prime motivation behind the assaults.  Examples: A woman fires gun shots into the men’s locker room of a fitness center, saying she hates men for rejecting her. Hours after Islamic extremists launch a terrorist attack in Europe, someone defaces an American mosque with graffiti that says ”Go home, terrorists!”   Mission offenders  These are the deadliest    and rarest    types of hate crimes. They are committed by people who consider themselves ”crusaders,” often for a racial or religious cause. Their mission: total war against members of a rival race or religion. They are often linked to groups that share their racist views.  Mission offenders write lengthy manifestos explaining their views, visit websites steeped in hate speech and violent imagery, and travel to target symbolically significant sites while seeking to maximize carnage. ”Mission offenders believe that the system is rigged against them, which means that they can justify excessive violence against innocents,” said Levin.  These hate crimes can look a lot like terrorism, and scholars say mission offenses often overlap both definitions, as in the case of a Muslim man who killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando last year. Former President Barack Obama called the massacre both ”an act of terror and an act of hate.”   Examples: Mission offenders tend to become infamous. According to criminologists, they include Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, Charleston church shooter Dylan Roof and Omar Mateen, who massacred 49 people at gay nightclub in Orlando.   What can be done?  McDevitt acknowledges limits to these categories. Crimes rarely fit cleanly into one or the other. ”Some people have multiple motivations. They may feel ’defensive,’ but also that it’s fun to go and harass someone.”  Edward Dunbar, a psychologist who has written widely about hate crimes, said the categories are valuable for training police and prosecutors but can’t predict or prevent   attacks.    ”To assess patterns of violence, or look at issues like capacity to benefit from rehabilitation, or to consider the evidence of premeditation, the typology is not the way to go.”  Still, the categories help communities learn how to respond to hate crimes, McDevitt and other experts say.  Many   offenders believe that society supports their violent prejudices. The Internet, with its hives of hate groups, has fed that feeling, especially with the ascendancy of the   during the 2016 presidential election.  It’s crucial for communities    and politicians    to clearly and unequivocally condemn hate crimes. McDevitt said that when he interviewed victims, they tended to want three things:  1) A statement from public officials denouncing the crime and the beliefs that inspired it. 2) For law officers to take the crime    and their duty to protect the vulnerable    seriously.  3) For communities to value them and make clear they don’t share the animosity that triggered the hate crimes.   In other words, behind every hate crime is a message: You are not welcome here.  Behind every strong community is another: Yes, you are.  "
35557,36339,55163,Police: Death of Muslim girl not believed to be hate crime,CNN,,2017-06-19,2017.0,6.0,," (CNN) Police in northern Virginia say a man fatally beat a Muslim teenager with a bat during a weekend   incident. But there’s no evidence the death of Nabra Hassanen, 17, who was attacked early Sunday as she and a group of teenagers walked back to a mosque, was a hate crime, authorities in Fairfax County said. Police said they could file appropriate charges if they later find the crime was motivated by hate.  The Reston teenager’s father said he believes Nabra was killed because she was wearing an abaya, a traditional black cloak. Police say Darwin Martinez Torres, of Sterling saw the group walking and riding bicycles in the street and on the sidewalk. Torres became so enraged after arguing with one teen he drove up on a curb, police said. He later found the group in a nearby parking lot, chased them on foot with a baseball bat and allegedly beat Nabra. Torres, 22, put the injured teen in his car, officials said. Her body was found Sunday evening in Loudoun County. ”There is nothing at this point to indicate that this tragic case was a hate crime,” said Julie Parker, a spokeswoman for the Fairfax County Police Department.  Nabra died from   trauma to the head and neck, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of Northern Virginia said.  Less than two hours after the incident, Fairfax County police arrested Torres in a traffic stop after an officer noticed what he believed to be the car involved in the incident, police said.  Torres has been charged with murder. He is being held without bond. It wasn’t immediately clear whether he had an attorney. Authorities said they believe Torres acted alone. Immigration officials have asked a Fairfax detention center to put a hold on Torres, a native of El Salvador. The hold, known as a detainer, is issued to keep suspected deportable immigrants for an additional 48 hours beyond what they could otherwise be released. ’Anger’ allegedly led him to hit teenager, Police and Nabra’s family said the group of friends had left the All Dulles Area Muslim Society (ADAMS) Center after midnight prayers, heading to a McDonald’s before the next fast began. The mosque holds prayers throughout the night during the observance of Ramadan, said Tajul Islam, a receptionist at the ADAMS Center. Police said there is no indication of any racial or ethnic slurs were exchanged between Torres and the group when they encountered each other. Police did not reveal the details of the argument between the teen on the bicycle and Torres. ”His anger over that earlier encounter then led to violence when he hit Nabra with a baseball bat,” Parker said of the beating.  Father: ’This is a hate crime’ Nabra’s death has shaken the local Muslim community.  On Monday, her friends gathered outside her Reston apartment with flowers. In another apartment, her father, Mahmoud Hassanen, grieved with friends and neighbors while her mother mourned separately several doors away.  More than 40 Muslim families live together in the quiet Cedar Ridge apartment complex. Mahmoud Hassanen told CNN he believes his daughter was targeted because of her religion.  ”This is a hate crime,” he said. ”It’s racism. Getting killed because she’s Muslim.”  He said his daughter ”loved everybody. She liked to help other people.”  Hassanen said he immigrated from Egypt in 1987 and that he is an American citizen.  Nabra, the oldest of four sisters, was born in Washington, D. C. her father said.  His first born was ”a beautiful lady,” who excelled in school, he said. ”She liked music. She liked fashion.” He said Nabra fell down as her friends got away before the alleged beating.  ”I feel sorry for the guy who take my daughter’s life,” Hassanen said. ”Why? We have to help each other, Muslim, Christian, Jew.” Crying, wiping tears from his eyes, he said he taught his children ”how to love other people.”  ”She’s gone,” he said. ”She’s not going to come back.”  He said Nabra’s    sister asked for her on Monday morning. He didn’t have an answer, he said.  Timing of attack raising concerns, Despite what law enforcement says, its timing coming amidst a recent spike in attacks on Muslims raised concerns in the Muslim community and prompted calls for increased security  Ibrahim Hooper, spokesperson for the Council on American Islamic Relations, told CNN that his organization will be calling for a thorough investigation of a possible biased motive.  ”We’d like to hear from the witnesses to the initial attack as to whether they heard any biased statements,” Hooper said. ”Even if not, why is this individual targeting a group of people dressed in Muslim attire? ”Would they have been targeted if they hadn’t been of a certain faith or ethnicity? These are the kinds of questions we ask,” he said.  The attack happened hours before a man drove a van into a crowd of worshipers at a mosque in London. ”We are devastated and heartbroken as our community undergoes and processes this traumatic event,” said the ADAMS Center in a statement. ”It is a time for us to come together to pray and care for our youth.”  A crowdfunding campaign for the girl’s family has already raised more than $220, 000.

35907,36750,55578,How to fight environmental crime,CNN,,2016-06-06,2016.0,6.0,," (CNN) The ramshackle corrugated roofs that shelter the Benfica Market in Angola stand in stark contrast to the ordered rows of gleaming ivory trinkets on the tables underneath. The trinkets are carved from tusks taken from the carcasses of elephants killed for their ivory.   Sadly, the demand for ivory products like these has triggered a spree of elephant killing across Africa. Some 100, 000 elephants were butchered between 2010 and 2012 by poachers desperate to profit from the rising demand for ivory in Asia. Markets like Benfica    the largest in southern Africa    alongside others in Nigeria and South Sudan are at the heart of this gruesome trade.  That is why Angola’s recent announcement that it will take steps to shutter the Benfica market is a large stride forward in the country’s efforts to end a trade that threatens one of the animal kingdom’s most magnificent creatures it’s a courageous move that serves as a powerful symbol of what can be achieved when governments act.  But in the meantime, the killing continues, aided by corruption and weak law enforcement. Simply closing markets will not be enough to end the illegal trade in wildlife, nor will it be enough to end the broader problem of environmental crime, which is rapidly becoming one of the most significant threats to global security. From the trafficking of hazardous waste to the illegal sale of gold and other minerals, environmental crime is on the rise across the world. International criminal gangs, rebel groups and   fraudsters are increasingly taking advantage of lax laws and   law enforcement agencies to reap huge profits from a crime that destroys vital ecosystems and threatens to wipe out species.  The value of environmental crime is now growing at a rate up to three times that of the global economy, according to a report recently released by UNEP and Interpol. Estimates of the value of environmental crime range from between $91 billion and $258 billion, 26% higher than previously estimated in 2014. Even at the low end, it has outpaced the illegal trade in small arms to become the fourth largest criminal enterprise in the world after drug smuggling, counterfeiting and human trafficking.  The silent victims of this crime are the forests, marine ecosystems, animals, plants, corals and rivers targeted by criminals for the profits they generate. Not only are these profits enormous, but the financial fallout is equivalently large: the total cost in terms of the damage done to ecosystems from environmental crime stands at billions of dollars annually.  But there are human victims, too. The profits from environmental crime breed insecurity around the world. Civil wars, criminal cartels, and even terror groups such as ISIS are funded by proceeds from illegally traded natural resources. Illegal gold mining in Colombia, for example, is now considered the easiest way to launder money from the country’s drug trade.   There are also indirect impacts. The loss in government revenue from environmental crime is thought to range from $9 billion to $26 billion every year. This is money that could be spent training teachers, building infrastructure, and protecting ecosystems from the very crime that is destroying them.  How can we respond? Combating environmental crime requires a multipronged approach.   First, the international community must move to strengthen the environmental rule of law    improving legislation and effectively penalizing      if it is to succeed in disrupting overseas tax havens used by environmental criminals to launder illicit profits.  Second, to combat environmental crime more directly, governments need a more cohesive approach. Brazil has already proved that this approach works. Robust command and control centers, improved intelligence gathering, the use of satellites and increased enforcement of protected areas resulted in a crackdown on criminal cartels that resulted in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon being reduced by 76%.  And since much of this crime is transacted across national frontiers, law enforcement agencies need to improve the gathering, analysis and sharing of intelligence on environmental crime at an international level.   Finally    and perhaps most urgently    we need to eliminate demand for the products that come from this type of crime, like the ivory trinkets found in markets across Africa. We can do this by raising consumer awareness of the tragedy of environmental crime.   In an effort to do just this, the United Nations recently launched one of the most ambitious awareness campaigns in years targeting the illegal trade in wildlife, encouraging people to find their own kindred species and use the hashtag #WildforLife to spread the word about the enormous impact of the trade.  The reality is that the sheer extent of environmental crime means that we cannot solve this problem overnight. But every day without action is a day that our ecosystems suffer    and also the people who rely on them for their livelihoods. We all need to commit to bringing environmental crime to an end. It is only through collective action that we can stop this tragedy.  Join us on Facebook. . Read CNNOpinion’s Flipboard magazine."
36152,37034,55864,Hate crime reports surge in Britain in weeks around ’Brexit’ ,CNN,,2016-07-08,2016.0,7.0,,"London (CNN) Reports of hate crimes surged around the UK’s ”Brexit” vote, and on Friday, police explained just how ugly things got. Police painted a grim picture of the last two weeks of June, saying reports of hate crimes rose by 42% compared with the same period in 2015, in the   and aftermath of the June 23 vote on whether to stay in or leave the European Union. Authorities announced that 3, 076 hate crimes were reported between June 16 and 30, or 915 more cases compared with the period in 2015, the National Police Chiefs’ Council said.  Incidents of hate crimes had increased so much that police around the country were asked to submit weekly reports about their areas, the council said in a statement. ’Everyone has the right to feel safe’ The council’s head of hate crime, Mark Hamilton, said that police forces had heightened their response over the last 10 days.  ”We now have a clear indication of the increases in the reporting of hate crime nationally and can see that there has been a sharp rise in recent weeks. This is unacceptable, and it undermines the diversity and tolerance we should instead be celebrating,” Hamilton said in the statement.  ”Everyone has the right to feel safe and confident about who they are and should not be made to feel vulnerable or at risk.” Reports of hate crimes peaked two days after Britain voted to leave the European Union in a referendum, with 289 offenses across the UK that day alone, the council said. There has been a significant decrease since then, it said.  Much of the debate on ”Brexit” had focused on the issue of immigration, with critics often accusing the ”Leave” campaign of xenophobia and prejudice. Scare at London mosques, The main type of offense recorded in the last half of June was harassment, common assault and other violence, such as verbal abuse, spitting and shoving, the council statement said.  The council’s announcement on hate crimes came a day after as several mosques in London reported being sent white powder in envelopes, one with a racist term for Pakistanis and the word ”filth” written on it and a picture of a mosque crossed out, British media reported, adding that the powder turned out to be harmless. Parts of the UK Parliament also were forced to close after a Muslim member of the House of Lords received a similar package that turned out to be harmless, reports said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday announced a citywide crackdown on hate crimes on public transportation. ”I simply will not tolerate hate crimes of any form, anywhere in London,” Khan said. ”We must stand together, and anyone who sees or is targeted by abusive behavior should report it to the police immediately.” #Safetypin: How Brits are fighting   racism, There has been a backlash to the hate crimes, with social media hashtags and campaigns showing solidarity with minorities.  The hashtag #PostRefRacism was set up for people to share experiences of hate crimes after the referendum on the EU. Others wore safety pins in a campaign to support safety in public for Britain’s immigrants and ethnic minorities."
36361,37279,56111,Terrorism: The jihad-crime nexus,CNN,Peter Bergen,2016-07-17,2016.0,7.0,," (CNN) There have been eight lethal terrorist attacks in Europe since 2014, five of them in France alone, carried out by ISIS or by ”lone wolves” inspired by the terror group or by al Qaeda.   What do these attacks have in common? The terrorists are almost invariably criminals who have either served time in the French or Belgian prison systems, or they have been convicted for lesser offenses but have avoided jail time.  Mohamed   who killed at least 84 people Thursday in Nice, France, had a long record of petty crimes. Bouhlel assaulted a motorist last year for which he received a   suspended sentence. It is not yet clear how exactly Bouhlel came to commit his terror attack. But it is striking how many of the terrorism cases in Europe share a   nexus. By contrast, of the more than 300 individuals charged of a jihadist terrorism crime in the United States since   only about 10% had a background of crimes other than terrorism.  Larossi Abballa, who stabbed a police commander and his partner to death in June in a town outside Paris, had been convicted of recruiting jihadists to fight in Pakistan. He was sentenced to 2½ years in prison in 2013 but was released shortly after his conviction because he had spent more than two years in jail awaiting trial, where he had preached about Islam to other prisoners. The Kouachi brothers, the perpetrators of the January 2015 attack at the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo, had been imprisoned for a range of crimes, including involvement in a terrorist organization as well as trafficking in counterfeit sneakers.   Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four Jews at a kosher supermarket in Paris shortly after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, was a close friend of the Kouachi brothers. He met Chérif Kouachi in prison while he was serving a   sentence for armed bank robbery. It is there where they were both radicalized, in part by an incarcerated al Qaeda recruiter.  Prisons in France and Belgium have incubated many jihadist terrorists. This is because the proportion of the French prison population that is Muslim is estimated to be around 60% which is extraordinarily high given that Muslims account for 8% of France’s population.  In Belgian prisons, there is a similar disproportionality:   percent of the prison population is Muslim, compared with 6% of the general population.   Conditions in these prisons and society in general exacerbate the spread of radicalism. Despite their high Muslim population, many of these prisons lack an adequate number of Muslim chaplains. This leaves the door open for Islamist militants among the prison population to spread their ideology during mealtimes and exercise hours through informal preaching sessions.  Muslims in France and Belgium have long been marginalized. They are often sequestered in poorer and more violent neighborhoods than their counterparts in the United States and are subject to pervasive racial discrimination.  French and Belgian prisons have proven to be universities of jihad. The members of the ISIS cell responsible for the attacks in Paris in November that killed 130 and the attacks in March in Brussels, Belgium, at the airport and on the subway system that killed 32, bonded through criminal activities or in prison.  Abdelhamid Abaaoud and Salah Abdeslam, the cell’s masterminds, were childhood friends who grew up in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek. In 2010, the men were arrested and spent time in the same prison.  Ibrahim Abdeslam, Salah’s brother, also spent time in prison with Abaaoud. He would go on to be one of the terrorists in the November Paris attacks.  Khalid and Ibrahim El Bakraoui, both suicide bombers in the Brussels attacks, had served lengthy prison sentences for armed robbery and assault on police.  ISIS recruit Mehdi Nemmouche, who is accused of killing four at the Jewish Museum in Brussels in 2014, had been in a French prison for robbery. How to stop prison radicalization? France has begun to implement new measures, such as separating militants from the general prison population and placing them in solitary confinement so they cannot exert their ideological influence on other inmates.  But more needs to be done    not only to identify those who go into prison as radicals, but also, crucially, to identify those who come out of prison more militant, as seems to have been the case of so many terrorists who have launched attacks in France and Belgium in the last three years."
36524,37476,56309,"Violent crime rising in US cities, study finds",CNN,Wesley Bruer,2016-07-26,2016.0,7.0,," (CNN) Violent crime is on the rise so far this year in major cities across the US compared to the number of homicides, rapes, robberies, assaults and shootings that occurred in the same cities by this point in 2015, a new report has found. The midyear violent crime survey released Monday by the Major Cities Chiefs Association shows 307 more homicides so far in 2016, according to data from 51 law enforcement agencies from some of the largest US cities. In addition to a large increase in homicides, major cities in the US have experienced more than 1, 000 more robberies, almost 2, 000 more aggravated assaults and more than 600   shootings in 2016 compared to this time last year. The only category of violent crime not reflecting an increase when compared to last year is rape.  The 316 homicides reported by the Chicago Police Department were by far the most of any law enforcement agency included in the survey, a 48% increase over last year. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said there were 110 homicides so far this year, compared to 85 in 2015. San Jose’s 25 homicides more than doubled the amount during the same period last year. Data for New York City was notably absent from the report. The association said it had not yet received data for the nation’s largest city in time for its study. The MCCA is comprised of police chiefs and sheriffs representing the 68 largest law enforcement offices in the US and was created to discuss common law enforcement issues and ways to solve them in urban areas. In May, the same group released another report which showed a 9% increase in homicides across dozens of US cities over the first three months of 2016 compared to the previous year. Responding to Donald Trump’s convention speech last week, in which the Republican presidential nominee spoke of rising crime and violent threats, President Barack Obama downplayed the notion that violence is increasing in the US, though he conceded that there has been an uptick in violence in some major cities. ”This idea that America is somehow on the verge of collapse, this vision of violence and chaos everywhere, doesn’t really jibe with the experience of most people,” Obama said during a press conference in the White House East Room alongside Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.  ”Although it is true that we’ve seen an uptick in murders and violent crime in some cities this year, the fact of the matter is that the murder rate today, the violence rate today is far lower than it was when Ronald Reagan was president and lower than when I took office,” Obama added."
36651,37637,56476,"Trump says Putin is ’not going to go into Ukraine,’ despite Crimea",CNN,Eric Bradner,2016-07-31,2016.0,7.0,,"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump said Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin won’t make a military move into Ukraine    even though Putin already has done just that, seizing the country’s Crimean Peninsula.  ”He’s not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He’s not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want,” Trump said in an interview on Sunday with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on ”This Week.”  ”Well, he’s already there, isn’t he?” Stephanopoulos responded, in a reference to Crimea, which Putin took from Ukraine in early 2014. Trump said: ”OK    well, he’s there in a certain way. But I’m not there. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you’re talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this. In the meantime, he’s going away. He takes Crimea.” Trump attempted to clarify his position on the conflict between Ukraine and Russia in a series of tweets Monday morning, after he was criticized for his muddled response in the interview. He explained that when he said Russia wouldn’t move into Ukraine, he was referring to a time when he is president.  ”When I said in an interview that Putin is ’not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down,’ I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! ,” Trump wrote. And he argued that the conflict over Crimea was the fault of the Obama administration, writing: ”So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That’s what I said!” Trump also pushed back against the criticism during a campaign event Monday in Columbus, Ohio. ”You want to go back? You want to go back and have World War 3? That was on Obama’s watch,” Trump said of the invasion. Trump also responded to criticism that he has been too complimentary of Russian President Vladimir Putin: ”Wouldn’t it be great if we got along with Russia?” he said. During the ABC interview, Stephanopoulos interjected to note that Trump has suggested he could recognize Russia’s claim on Crimea over Ukraine’s    and Trump didn’t back away from that possibility in the interview.  ”I’m going to take a look at it,” he said. ”But you know, the people of Crimea, from what I’ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also . .. just so you understand, that was done under Obama’s administration.” Trump added: ”And as far as the Ukraine is concerned, it’s a mess. And that’s under the Obama’s administration with his strong ties to NATO. So with all of these strong ties to NATO, Ukraine is a mess. Crimea has been taken. Don’t blame Donald Trump for that.”  The Clinton campaign responded later Sunday, with senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan saying: ”What is he talking about? Russia is already in Ukraine. Does he not know that? What else doesn’t he know?” ”Today, (Trump) gamely repeated Putin’s argument that Russia was justified in seizing the sovereign territory of another country by force. This is scary stuff,” Sullivan said in a statement. ”But it shouldn’t surprise us. This comes on the heels of his tacit invitation to the Russians to invade our NATO allies in Eastern Europe.” Stephanopoulos also pressed Trump on changes to the Republican platform removing calls for the provision of lethal weapons so the people of Ukraine can defend themselves, which Trump said he had nothing to do with.  And he asked about Trump’s claims in recent years that he has a personal relationship with Putin.  ”I have no relationship with Putin. I have no relationship with Putin,” Trump said.  ”Just so you understand, he said very nice things about me. But I have no relationship with him. I don’t    I’ve never met him,” said Trump. But in a November 2015 Republican primary debate, Trump had said of Putin: ”I got to know him very well because we were both on ’60 Minutes,’ we were stablemates.” "

How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities,” Trump said during a speech here to a conference of shale oil and natural gas producers. After police shot a man officials say was armed, two nights of protests followed there, slipping into violence Wednesday night with numerous civilian and police injuries reported, as well as looting and property destruction. Trump, who has focused on restoring ”law and order” in his presidential campaign, seized on the unrest in Charlotte to renew his call for    policies to bring down crime rates in major American cities and once again appeal to   to join his campaign. ”The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are     residents who live in these communities where crime is so rampant,” Trump said. ”There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration, ever, ever.” RELATED: Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violence, Trump also tied the eruption of violent protests on Wednesday night to drugs, saying in Pittsburgh that ”drugs are a very, very big factor in what you’re watching on television at night”    though he offered no evidence to back up that claim. Steven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, later said it was ”obvious” Trump was ”referring to the recent increase in drug related deaths and subsequent news reports, thus making it a hot button issue.” Praised    Trump praised the policing practiced under former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, which included the use of ”  ” and a greater crackdown on misdemeanor offenses and has been credited with helping bring down the city’s crime rate during the 1990s. ”Think of how many families these policies saved from the worst heartache possible,” Trump said of Giuliani, who is now a top adviser and surrogate. Speaking to Fox News a day earlier, Trump spoke out in favor of the controversial    policy Giuliani put in place in New York which was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2013 for being a ”policy of indirect racial profiling.” Trump said Thursday morning that he was calling for that policy to be implemented in Chicago, where gun violence has skyrocketed, with more than 3, 000 people shot in that city so far this year. RELATED: New York mayor: Donald Trump wrong about ’  ’ During that interview, Trump also highlighted what he saw as a ”lack of spirit” between communities.  ”It just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black. I mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he said.  Trump offered few details in his Pittsburgh speech of what would be included in his ”national   agenda to make our cities safe again,” beyond saying that he will ”make reduction of crime a top priority” and appoint ”the best” prosecutors and federal investigators to go after criminal gangs and cartels. Trump has previously said that he would look to increase the number of police officers in inner cities to bring down the crime rate and improve training, but has offered little other specifics on this policy front. ”Safety is the foundation of the ladder to American success,” he said. Asked Wednesday about the police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa, Oklahoma, that have reignited the debate over race and policing in the country, Trump did not address the Charlotte incident but said he was ”very, very troubled” by the shooting of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, in Tulsa on Friday night. Trump suggested the police officer who fatally shot Crutcher ”got scared” or ”was choking,” referring to individuals who fail under pressure."
37958,39182,58032,Reality Check: Trump misleads when it comes to rising crime rates,CNN,Steven A. Holmes,2016-09-24,2016.0,9.0,,"Washington (CNN) It is a staple of Donald Trump’s stump speech, intended to show that the country is experiencing a frightening crime wave.  ”Last year we saw a 17% increase in violent crime in our 50 largest cities,” he often says. Trump used to say that it was a 17% increase in homicides in the country’s 50 largest cities. He now says that increase is in ”violent crimes.” Since Trump does not say what he considers violent crimes, it is difficult to check his figures. A yearly survey conducted by the Major Cities Chiefs Association showed that homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault and   shootings increased by about 2% in 65 major jurisdictions.  (The chiefs’ association list includes large counties such as Los Angeles County and Prince Georges County, Maryland    outside Washington    as well as cities such as Pittsburgh, Newark, New Jersey, and Cincinnati that are not among the nation’s 50 largest.) But if Trump’s claim is that the number of homicides in 2015 was 17% larger than the number of murders in 2014, he is closer to the mark. The major chiefs association survey showed that murders did increase by nearly 16% among its members. And a survey of the country’s 30 largest cities done by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice indicated an increase in homicides of 14%. But these numbers do not represent an    increase in homicides for major jurisdictions, nor that an unprecedented wave of killings is hitting virtually all big cities.  In fact, only three cities    Baltimore, Chicago and Washington    account for more than half of the national increase in murders, according to the Brennan Center survey. If you take those three cities out of the equation, the number of murders only jumped by about 7% in the nation’s largest cities.   ”I think Trump’s figure is more misleading than inaccurate,” said Inimai M. Chettiar, the director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center. Verdict: True, but misleading."
38326,39609,58467,Vladimir Putin snubs France after Syria war crimes comments,CNN,,2016-10-11,2016.0,10.0,," (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin has canceled a planned visit to France next week, the Kremlin said Tuesday, in an apparent snub to French President François Hollande, who suggested Moscow was guilty of war crimes in Syria. Tensions have been rumbling between the two leaders since the weekend, when Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution aimed at ending Syrian regime airstrikes on Aleppo and allowing humanitarian aid into the city. France and Spain had put forward the resolution. ”The President has made a decision to cancel this visit (to Paris),” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian   news agency TASS.  Putin was scheduled to attend events linked to the opening of a Russian religious and cultural center, but the trip was canceled because the events ”fell out of the program.” But a French government official told CNN that Putin canceled because he did not agree with Hollande’s request that the meeting be dedicated to Syria. Hollande had earlier suggested to French TV station TF1 that he was mulling whether to cancel the meeting with Putin, saying that those behind the bombardment of Aleppo    alluding to Syria and Russia    had committed ”war crimes” in the Syrian city and should be held accountable at the International Criminal Court.  Putin was scheduled to visit Paris October 19.  Debating whether to meet Putin, Hollande told TF1: ”I have asked myself that question: Is it useful? Is it necessary? Could we do something that pushes him as well and stop what they’re doing with the Syrian regime    that is to say the help they are providing to the Syrian regime, which sends bombs to the population of Aleppo? ”If I receive him, I would tell him that it is unacceptable, that it is bad even for the image of Russia. What I tell them, is that these populations are populations that are today victims of war crimes and those who commit those acts will have to pay for their responsibility in front of the International Criminal Court.” Russia has carried out airstrikes in Syria since September 2015 in coordination with President Bashar  ’s regime. Moscow says it is targeting militant groups, but the United States is arming some of those same groups to fight the Assad government, essentially pitting the Cold War enemies against each other.  Fresh strikes on Aleppo, After six days of relative calm in Aleppo, renewed airstrikes on   areas killed at least 41 people on Tuesday, according to activists and residents.  Around 20 airstrikes, including cluster munitions and   bombs, hit seven neighborhoods in the besieged eastern parts of the city, according to an activist with the Aleppo Media Center (AMC). The heaviest strikes occurred in the neighborhood of Bustan   with several missiles landing near a market and a school, according to residents and activists. Stranglehold in Aleppo, Russia’s UN veto on the Aleppo resolution Saturday had been widely expected. Hollande’s war crimes comments echo those of US Secretary of State John Kerry, who said airstrikes by Syrian forces with Russian support should be investigated. ”Russia and the regime owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities, and children and women. These are acts that beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes,” Kerry said.  In July, regime forces encircled   parts of Aleppo, mostly in the city’s east, creating a stranglehold that cut the population off from basic food, water, medical and fuel supplies. Aid agencies have struggled to make deliveries into the besieged city. An aid convoy last month was attacked when it was finally able to enter after a   ceasefire.  The Syrian regime has pounded   Aleppo with airstrikes since July, but it scaled back last week as it began a ground offensive to take back parts of the city. It has been accused of using chemical weapons, such as chlorine gas, on the population there, an allegation that Syria and Russia deny.  Rebels have held parts of eastern Aleppo since 2012.  So what’s behind the apparent snub? Putin survives on his popularity, which is built on his image as a strongman, and his image would be damaged if he went to Paris just as the French were essentially calling on Russia to be tried for war crimes, explained CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson.  In his own country, a French visit would look weak, and that’s the most important thing to him, Robertson added. France’s accusations of war crimes appear to be part of a growing trend. The United States has also accused Russia of war crimes as it has tried every other form of diplomacy.  The world has expected Russia to put pressure on Assad    and it’s believed that Moscow hasn’t acted in good faith, so the world now needs to put pressure on Russia, Robertson said.  And one way to do that is by publicly pointing out to Russia that at some point in the future, it could be held accountable for war crimes    killing civilians, breaking the conventions of war and international humanitarian conventions, like targeting hospitals. While Russia has strongly denied war crimes allegations, Robertson explained, Western powers see legitimate grounds to call for investigations, and for these investigations to focus on Russia.  Putin’s decision to cancel his trip also shows a growing gap between Russia and France, and Russia with Europe at large. The EU is looking at developing a common defense policy, which at the moment is in effect NATO.  Russia and Putin have been extremely angered over the past decade, at least whenever NATO bolsters its forces along its eastern borders, while NATO sees Russia as developing hardened and more secure defense facilities all the way from Kaliningrad in the north now to Syria, with their announcement of a permanent military base there.  There are also implications for Ukraine. The Normandy 4    Ukraine, Russia, Germany and France    have been the principle states in addressing the Ukraine conflict. They brought about the Minsk Agreement that was supposed to solidify a ceasefire and bring back all of Ukraine’s borders under Kiev’s control. That hasn’t happened, Robertson said, so normally you would expect more dialogue to be going forward with this group. However, this incident with France and Russia makes that less likely and makes instability in Ukraine more likely. This also means Europe’s   sanctions on Russia are unlikely to be lifted anytime soon. "
38642,39985,58850,’Make America White Again’: Hate speech and crimes post-election,CNN,,2016-11-10,2016.0,11.0,," (CNN) Fears of heightened bigotry and hate crimes have turned into reality for some Americans after Donald Trump’s presidential win. And the list of incidents keeps growing.   The Southern Poverty Law Center counted 867 cases of hateful harassment or intimidation in the United States in the 10 days after the November 8 election.   The number of reported incidents declined almost every day from November 9, the day after the election, to November 18. But the incidents have been widespread, the SPLC said.  ”They’ve been everywhere    in schools, in places of business like Walmart, on the street,” SPLC President Richard Cohen said.  Critics accused Trump of fostering xenophobia and Islamophobia during the divisive presidential campaign. Recent days have witnessed ugly episodes of racist or     graffiti along with threats or attacks against Muslims.  The   said he was ”so saddened” to hear about vitriol hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. ”If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,” Trump told CBS’ ”60 Minutes.” Not all incidents are spurred by Trump supporters. A man in Chicago reportedly was beaten as a bystander yelled, ”You voted Trump!” And two men in Connecticut were arrested over assault allegations against a Trump supporter. The   incidents follow a year of heightened attacks against Muslim Americans. US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said FBI statistics for 2015 showed a 67% increase in hate crimes against Muslim Americans. Hate crimes against Jewish people, African Americans and LGBT individuals also increased.  Overall, reported hate crimes spiked 6% but the number could be higher because many incidents go unreported, Lynch said.  Here’s what some Americans are dealing with across the country: INTIMIDATION, VIOLENCE AFTER TRUMP WIN, Mosques get letters calling for genocide, A group calling itself ”Americans for a Better Way” sent copies of a letter to at least five California mosques, calling Muslims ”a vile and filthy people” and advocating genocide.   ”There’s a new sherriff [sic] in town    President Donald Trump,” reads the letter, which is addressed to ”the Children of Satan.”  ”He is going to cleanse America and make it shine again,” it continues. ”And, he’s going to start with you muslims [sic].  He’s going to do to you muslims [sic] what Hitler did to the jews [sic]. You muslims [sic] would be wise to pack your bags and get out of Dodge.” The San Jose Police Department called the letter a ” ” incident and said it will investigate. ’Go home’ scrawled on car, A Puerto Rican family’s car was vandalized on November 17, with the words ”Trump” and ”Go home” scratched into the car in West Springfield, Massachusetts, according to police and one of the victims, who spoke to CNN.  Jorge Santiago, an Army veteran who has served two deployments overseas, noticed scratches in the family’s red sedan after he put his daughter on the bus to school, said his wife, Toni Santiago. He reported the vandalism to the West Springfield police soon afterward, she said. West Springfield Police Department Capt. Daniel Spaulding said detectives are following up and the investigation is ongoing. They have not determined whether it was a hate crime. The Santiagos are the only minority family on their street, Toni Santiago said. Their family supported Hillary Clinton during the election, but they didn’t have any signs on their lawn,  Santiago said. They have one small Clinton sticker on their other car parked in their driveway closer to the house, which was not vandalized, Santiago said.  ”It is terrible. It is horrific, and still, in a way, I’m not surprised,” Santiago said. ”Racism was always there, but I feel now with our current President having been so vocal in some of the things he says, people feel more comfortable showing that racism, and our family was a target of it.” Both Toni and Jorge are US citizens, Santiago said. Jorge was born in Puerto Rico and has lived in Massachusetts for many years, Santiago said. Toni grew up in Massachusetts and is a social worker in nearby Holyoke, Massachusetts, she said. They have three children, ages 2, 8 and 12. Toni posted a photo of the vandalism to Facebook and shared it with CNN. ”My first reaction is we need to get this out. We need to do something,” Santiago said. ”People think ’it’s not going to happen in my town,’ or Massachusetts is a liberal state, but this is real hate, and it’s not OK.” Uber driver verbally assaulted, A motorist in a white SUV unleashed this hateful rant last week at an Uber driver in New York City. The Uber driver, a Muslim and a US citizen originally from Morocco, captured the incident on video. It occurred in the Astoria section of Queens on November 17. The Uber driver told CNN the motorist cut him off, yelled at him and continued to follow him for a few blocks. When they both pulled up to a stop, the man asked the Uber driver to roll down his window. The motorist then spewed profane and racist abuse at the man. One quote: ”Trump is president a****** so you can kiss your visa goodbye, scumbag. They’ll deport you soon, don’t worry, you f***ing terrorist.”  The Uber driver, who came to the United States about seven years ago, asked CNN that his name not be used over concerns for his and his family’s safety.  Chris Cody, the Uber driver’s next passenger, asked him how his day was going. The driver explained what had just happened and showed Cody his video, Cody told CNN.  Cody asked if he could post it on social media and share it with others, he told CNN.  Later that day, Cody put the video on his Facebook page, writing, ”this is not a political post. .. this is a post about the disgusting mentality that some uneducated  xenophobic Americans somehow still subscribe to in the 21st century.”  The video has gone viral. Vandalism at Adam Yauch Park, Swastikas and the word ”Go Trump” were painted on playground equipment at Adam Yauch Park in Brooklyn, according to New York police spokeswoman Annette Shelton. The park is named after the late Adam ”MCA” Yauch, a founding member of the pioneering rap band Beastie Boys.   The vandalism was discovered Friday afternoon, according to Shelton. A resident reported it to police, who are investigating the incident.  New York City Councilman Brad Lander, who represents that part of Brooklyn, wrote on Twitter: ”Yet more hatred    from Trump supporters.”  He also tweeted, ”No place for hate. We will not be cowed.” On Twitter, the Beastie Boys asked fans to join local officials Sunday morning at a rally in the park.   ”Hate has no place in Brooklyn, NYC, or America,” the tweet said. ”Join us . .. to stand against hate messages. Lander told CNN the graffiti had been painted over. Instagram images show hearts and flowers over the graffiti.   The swastika discovered Friday in a Brooklyn park was the 13th reported in the city since Election Day, according to Robert Boyce, chief of detectives for the New York Police Department. Other swastikas have been found in a school in Manhattan and a housing development in Brooklyn, Boyce told reporters. The number is up from two in the same period of time in November last year, Boyce said.  According to the New York police, the number of hate crimes in the city has increased 31. 5% in the year to date from 2015 to 2016    up from 250 to 328. Hate crimes targeting Muslims are up from 12 to 25, and hate crimes targeting Jews are up from 102 to 111, the police said.  Boyce said the swastika at the Brooklyn playground was the only one that included Trump’s name.  New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters this week, ”A lot of us are very concerned that a lot of divisive speech was used during the campaign by the   and we do not yet know what the impact of that will be on our country.” A note with obscenities, A woman reported a frightening incident that happened while she was hiking at Mission Peak in Fremont, California.   Nicki Pancholy had her car windows smashed and her purse stolen. A note containing obscenities and a reference to her ”hiljab” was left on the car’s windshield, according to CNN affiliate   in San Francisco. Pancholy has Lupus and wears a bandana to protect her from the sun. It has no religious significance, she said.  A hijab is the traditional head covering worn by many Muslim women.  ”I was surprised, I was taken aback by the ignorance,” Pancholy said on ”CNN Tonight” on Friday evening.   ”It breaks my heart that violence is spewing everywhere,” Pancholy said. ”It makes me wonder what our children will be facing, how will they cope with this? It’s a different America that they’re experiencing something that’s new to this generation.”  A swastika, the words ’Trump’ and ’die’ painted on car, In Denver, a transgender woman’s car was   early Wednesday morning with a swastika and the words ”Trump” and ”die,” among other derogatory terms.  Amber Timmons, 43, noticed the swastika as she was heading to her car to leave for work. She didn’t make it to work that day.  ”You get shocked, you don’t believe it’s going to happen to you,” she said. Before the vandalism, she had the words ”love trumps hate” written on her back window, and #notmypresident on the windows of the rear doors. And she intends to put those messages back on. ”Me and a couple of really good friends got together and got the spray paint off,” said Timmons, who does not intend to press charges. Her message to the perpetrators? ”That it’s OK,” she said. ”It was done out of fear. That’s what hate is. Hate is fear. And we can fix that fear by love. It’s OK. I forgive them.” The Denver Police Department’s Hate Crimes Unit is investigating the incident as a possible act of criminal mischief, though there are no suspects at the moment.   ’Build the wall’ chanted at high school tournament, Students from a small border town in northwest Texas say they were the target of ethnically charged slurs while warming up for a regional volleyball tournament. ”When they were saying ’Build that wall’ and holding the Trump sign, we knew it was for us,” Fort Hancock High School junior Jenna Aguilar told CNN affiliate   in El Paso after the game last week. Most of the school’s students are Hispanic. Amid the verbal abuse from the stands, apparently from supporters of the Archer City team, Fort Hancock coach Melissa Saldana called a timeout.  ”We’ve got to ignore what’s going on. We’ve got to stay focused and we’ve got to get tough,” Saldana said she told her players.   The Fort Hancock team lost, but Saldana said they were still victorious.   ”My girls, they rose above and they handled themselves very well,” Saldana told KVIA. The superintendent of the Archer City Independent School District apologized for the students’ actions, but Fort Hancock’s schools chief is still upset.  ”What troubles us is that no game official, an official at the venue, even the officials at the game, school officials, nobody stood up to put an end to this,” Fort Hancock Independent School District Superintendent Jose Franco told the station. ’Make America White Again,’ softball dugout reads, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ordered a joint investigation after someone painted a dugout wall in Wellsville, about 80 miles southeast of Buffalo.   The message: A swastika, surrounded by the words, ’Make America White Again.” The governor said both New York State Police and the State Division of Human Rights will investigate the alleged hate crime. ”New York has zero tolerance for bigotry, fear and hatred, and those who seek to undermine the core values this state and nation were founded upon,” Cuomo said.  ’Heil Trump’ painted on church, On Sunday morning, the Rev. Kelsey Hutto got the news that vandals had painted ”Heil Trump,” an   slur and a swastika on the side of her church, Saint David’s Episcopal in Beanblossom, Indiana. She told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota on Thursday that she was at first sad, but believes that the church was targeted because it has always been inclusive to everyone. So, she said, she is taking comfort that whoever did this actually did this for the right reason, because the church has always been welcoming to everyone. ”Doing the right thing is not always the popular thing.” In that spirit, the church has decided to leave the graffiti as is until November 30.  ”If we decide to look at these and be embarrassed, and consider them hateful and angry, and decide to cover them up, then we give power to the idea that hate is more powerful than love,” Hutto said. ”And that’s not the case.” The Brown County Sheriff’s Department tells CNN it is investigating the incident. Investigators don’t currently have any suspects or leads, but they have shared their report with the state police department and are hoping someone in the community will come forward with information if they have it. Swastika, ’Trump’ at New York campus  Hours after Cuomo reported the Wellsville incident, the governor announced another alleged hate crime    this one at the State University of New York College at Genese.  Someone   a swastika and the word ”Trump” on a dorm building.   ”It is unacceptable that this is the second investigation that we have had to announce in the last several hours,” Cuomo said in a statement Saturday.  ”To any New Yorker who is scared, I want you to know that we have your back, that we will keep you safe, and that protecting your rights is what America stands for.” Muslim student threatened with lighter, Police in Ann Arbor, Michigan, were investigating reports a man approached a Muslim student and threatened to set her on fire with a lighter unless she removed her hijab. The suspect is described as 20 to 30, unkempt and intoxicated, according to the University of Michigan. The Michigan chapter of the Council on   Relations said the alleged attack is among a spate of   incidents reported since Trump won the election.  ”Our nation’s leaders, and particularly   Donald Trump, need to speak out forcefully against the wave of   incidents sweeping the country after Tuesday’s election,” Executive Director Dawud Walid said. ’Trump!’ written on Muslim prayer room door in  New York, At New York University’s Tandon School of Engineering, students discovered Trump’s name written on the door to a prayer room for Muslims on Wednesday, school officials said. ”Our campus is not immune to the bigotry that grips America,” the NYU Muslim Students Association said in a Facebook posting.  School spokesman Kathleen Hamilton said the school has many immigrant students, with about 20% from abroad. ”It’s a real melting pot here,” she said. ”We all believe this very much, that the university is a place of free expression. It has to be safe to be so.” New York police are investigating.  Graffiti in high school: ’Trump,’ ’Whites only,’ ’White America’ Minnesota high school student Moses Karngbaye said he was terrified to see racist graffiti scrawled inside a bathroom.  Someone had written ”#Go back to Africa” and ”Make America great again” on a toilet paper dispenser at Maple Grove Senior High School.  ”That’s the first time I honestly felt like crying at school,” Karngbaye told CNN affiliate   in Minneapolis.  The bathroom door was also covered with graffiti, including ”Whites only,” ”White America” and ”Trump.”  Karngbaye sent photos of the graffiti to his mother, Denise Karngbaye, who told WCCO she takes the attack personally. ”I train my kids to respect everybody, regardless of their race, their ethnicity, their background,” she said.  Hate crime investigation at San Diego State University  A San Diego State University student walking to her car was confronted by two men who made comments about Trump and Muslims, SDSU police said.  ”Comments made to the student indicate she was targeted because of her Muslim faith, including her wearing of a traditional garment and hijab,” university President Elliot Hirshman said in a statement. The men grabbed the student’s purse and backpack and removed her keys. After the student returned from calling the police, her car was gone. The suspects are still at large.  Hirshman called the incident a hate crime.  ”We condemn this hateful act and urge all members of our community to join us in condemning such hateful acts,” he said. ”Hate crimes are destructive to the spirit of our campus, and we urge all members of our community to stand together in rejecting hate.”  Graffiti: Neither black lives nor black votes matter, The day after Trump’s victory, someone painted racist messages referencing the election on a wall in Durham, North Carolina.  ”Black lives don’t matter and neither does your votes,” the message said, according to CNN affiliate   in Goldsboro. On Thursday, crews came to paint over the graffiti.  Phyllis Terry, whose family owns the JC’s Kitchen restaurant next to the graffiti, told the affiliate she was heartened by the effort to cover up the message.  ”I am amazed. I am really touched this morning that the community has rallied together,” she said.   graffiti in Philadelphia  Someone   the words ”Sieg Heil 2016” and ”Trump”    with a swastika substituted for the T in Trump    on a building’s glass window on South Broad Street, police said. The words ”Trump Rules,” ”Trump Rules Black (expletive])” and the letter ”T” were   on three vehicles and a house on South Sixth Street. And a swastika and ”Trump” were written on a utility box at Broad and Reed streets. Police said surveillance video captured a male of unknown race   around 5 a. m. Wednesday. It was unclear if the graffiti were a protest of Trump or a   act. But the   League has denounced it. ”Swastikas and the Nazi salute send a message of intolerance and hate to the entire community,” the ADL’s regional director, Nancy K.   said in a statement.    said the group views the graffiti as an isolated incident, but stressed that ”we cannot allow this behavior to become routine.”  Black doll hung from rod at college, At Canisius College in west New York state, students posted photos of a black doll hanging from a dormitory curtain rod on social media, and one student created a meme with language about ”Trump fans,” college President John J. Hurley said. Students who saw those photos notified campus police, who investigated, Hurley said. Some students have been suspended and may be expelled, he said. An outside investigator will be hired to determine if any students should be prosecuted for possible hate crimes, as several parents and students urged, Hurley said. He did not name the students or say how many were involved, citing privacy concerns. On Wednesday, the school held an open session on the doll incident attended by about 300 people. ”It is clear to me that this episode has exposed some deeply held concerns among our students of color and that we need to go well beyond addressing the immediate incident involving the doll,” Hurley said. ’Deportation’ letters handed out at school, A student at Shasta High School in Redding, California, posted a video on Twitter of himself handing  letters with the word ”deportation” written across the top to half a dozen students, school district Superintendent Jim Cloney said in a statement. The students appeared to be of a variety of ethnicities, Cloney said. After talking to the student and his parents, the video was taken down. The student said he thought the video was funny, Cloney said. ”Needless to say, we don’t think this sort of behavior is funny nor reflective of the culture of Shasta High,” he said. He said appropriate discipline will be applied. TRUMP SUPPORTERS REPORT VIOLENCE, Trump supporter beaten in Maryland, police say, A young Trump supporter was beaten Wednesday by students during an   protest in Rockville, Maryland, police said. Police Maj. Eric Over said a juvenile has been charged with a misdemeanor in connection with the assault. He could face additional charges.  Police are reviewing a video of the incident. Over said the protest was largely peaceful. A witness, Kathy Silverstein, told CNN the young man who supported Trump came upon the protest and exchanged words with some demonstrators before the alleged assault occurred.      supporter: I was assaulted on subway  Corey Cataldo was riding a subway car to the Bronx when a man asked him whether he was a Trump supporter, police spokeswoman Sgt. Jessica McRorie said. When Cataldo said yes, the man grabbed him by the neck, hurting his left shoulder, McRorie said. Cataldo, 24, was wearing a white hat with the motto ”Make America Great Again” stitched on it, CNN affiliate   reported.   The electrician told WABC that as he was being chocked another man acted like he was going to help, but shoved him against a window. McRorie said no one has been arrested and the investigation into the reported incident continues.  CNN called a number listed for Cataldo and left a message seeking comment.  Men charged in beating of Trump supporter in Connecticut, Two men were arrested in the punching and kicking of a Connecticut man who was waving an American flag and holding a Trump sign on November 12, Meriden police said.  Wilson Eschevarria and Anthony Hobdy were charged with assault. The    victim told police that Eschevarria and Hobdy gave him the finger and he responded, ”Same to you.”  That’s when the two suspects started beating him, the man told police.    Man beaten as onlooker yells, ’You voted Trump!’ David Wilcox said he was struck by another vehicle while driving in a Chicago intersection. When he got out to try to get insurance information, men from the other car started attacking him.  ”You voted Trump!” a bystander screamed as a man punched Wilcox in the head. Another tried to kick him in the face.  Wilcox said he doesn’t think his attackers knew who he voted for. Still, the assumption was already made.  Even though he was beaten on the street in broad daylight, Wilcox said, ”Nobody did anything to help.”  On top of that, someone stole Wilcox’s car. Police are investigating.  FROM VIOLENCE TO UNITY, Baylor University: 300 students escort victim to class, Amid all the physical and verbal attacks, hundreds of Baylor University students rallied behind Natasha Nkhama to make sure she felt safe leaving class.  Nkhama said she was walking to class last week when a guy ”went out of his way to bump into me and shove me off the sidewalk.” ”He said, ’No        allowed on the sidewalk,’” Nkhama said in a video posted to Twitter last Wednesday. ”I was just shocked, like I had no words.” Nkhama said two men she did not know defended her, asking the student what he was doing. ”The guy said, ’Dude, like what, I’m just trying to make America great again,’” Nkhama said. The university said it was ”aware of a student who was pushed and subjected to racially offensive language,” an incident it describes as ”deeply disturbing and does not in any way reflect Baylor’s faith or values.” Nkhama’s video and #IWalkWithNatasha quickly spread across social media. When Nkhama walked out of a class Friday, about 300 students stood by the door, waiting to walk her to her next class, according to campus police.   Nkhama broke down in tears.   ”I just wanted to thank everyone for being here, and I want everyone who sees this to know that Baylor is a campus of love,” Nkhama said.  She also thanked the two students who came to her defense when she was assaulted.   ”To whoever defended me that day, I don’t know who you are, but I thank you honestly and thank you for being an example to everyone on campus.” WHAT THE TEACHER SAID, ’Back to Africa’ comment in Florida, A faculty member at a Pasco County, Florida, high school has been accused of telling a group of   students standing in a hallway, ”Don’t make me call Donald Trump to get you sent back to Africa.” The Wesley Chapel High School teacher, who is also the golf coach, allegedly made the remark the day after Trump was elected. The school system is investigating. ”As soon as the students reported the incident to administrators at the school on Wednesday, November 9, (the teacher) was sent home on administrative leave, where he remains,” Pasco County Schools spokeswoman Linda E. Cobbe told CNN. The teacher did not return a phone call and emails from CNN seeking comment."
38847,40225,59091,Spike in hate crimes prompts special NY police unit,CNN,Amy La Porte,2016-11-21,2016.0,11.0,," (CNN) An ”explosion” in hate crimes since Election Day has prompted the creation of a special police unit to fight the uptick in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday.  The announcement coincided with an address at Harlem’s Abyssinian Baptist Church, where Cuomo called for an end to the divisiveness that has gripped the country. ”The ugly political discourse of the election did not end on Election Day. In many ways it has gotten worse, [turning] into a social crisis that now challenges our identity as a state and as a nation and our people,” he said.   Donald Trump wasn’t specifically mentioned in his church address, but Cuomo has in the past criticized Trump and vowed in a New York Daily News   that he would ”reject the hateful attitudes that pervaded throughout the 2016 campaign.” The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since the election.  A   hot line that Cuomo launched on November 15 to connect New Yorkers with the state Division of Human Rights to report incidents of bias and discrimination has received more than 400 calls since Friday, according to Cuomo’s office. Calling this kind of prejudice a ”social poison [in] the fabric of our nation,” the governor cited a number of recent incidents, including a scourge of swastika graffiti and the case of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania being sent pictures of lynchings and racial slurs. Cuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration. He said the fund would be the first of its kind.  The plan, he said, would be to set up a   partnership ”to provide immigrants who can’t afford their own defense the legal assistance they need . .. because in New York, we believe in justice for all,” Cuomo said. He added, ”If there is a move to deport immigrants then I say start with me. I am a son of immigrants. Son of Mario Cuomo, who is the son of Andrea Cuomo, a poor Italian immigrant who came to this country without a job, without money, or resources and he was here only for the promise of America.” Cuomo’s plans also include the expansion of New York’s Human Rights Law to protect students who are bullied or discriminated against. New York Police Department Commissioner James O’Neill told a New York radio station on Sunday he was disturbed by the trends.  ”We’ve had an uptick in hate crimes, actually a little bit more than an uptick. We’re up 31% from last year. We had at this time last year 250, this year we have 328, specifically against the Muslim population in New York City    we went up from 12 to 25, and   is up, too, by 9% from 102 to 111,” O’Neill said.  ”I have no scientific evidence as to why, but you’ve been paying attention to what’s been going on in the country over the last year or so and the rhetoric has increased, and I think that might have something to do with it,” O’Neill added.  Cuomo said on Sunday that New York’s tolerance will lead the way for the rest of the nation, and his announcement came as an ” ” rally was held in a Brooklyn park vandalized with swastikas and   graffiti. The rally, at a playground named after the late Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, was attended by band member Adam Horovitz, better known as  . ”Keep your eyes open, stand up for each other. This is homegrown terrorism for real,” Horovitz told the crowd. ”I reject Donald Trump’s vision for America. New York City, I’m asking you to do the same.”"
40504,42332,61275,Court: Adultery now not a crime in South Korea,CNN,Greg Botelho,2015-02-26,2015.0,2.0,,"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) For 62 years, if you cheated on your husband or wife in South Korea, you could end up in prison. Not anymore. South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Thursday overturned a law that made adultery a crime, saying it violates the East Asian nation’s constitution. ”The precondition of human dignity and right to pursue happiness is for each individual to have their rights to choose their fate,” the court ruled, saying that one’s sex life is private. ”And the rights to choose their fate includes rights to be engaged in sex and choosing the partner.” Up until then, anyone who cheated on their spouse could be charged and, if convicted, spent up to two years in prison. The same penalty also applied to ”the one who fornicated with the” cheating spouse, according to the Constitutional Court’s website. But that’s changing because South Korean society has changed enough ”to lose many parts of (the   law’s) reason to exist,” the prevailing judges said, according to a news release summarizing their decision. The chief reason for originally enacting the adultery law was to protect women, these justices contended. The idea was that men    who tended to be economically and socially more powerful    took advantage of women. And if a man was charged criminally, that would give women more leverage in divorce proceedings. (In other words, a wronged wife might get more compensation after deciding to drop the charges.) Yet 2015 isn’t 1953, when the law first went into the affect, according to the judges. After all, the current president of South Korea    Park      is a woman. ”Women are active socially and economically, and women no longer apply as economically weaker,” these judges wrote. ”. .. In addition, the law cannot be viewed as (exclusively) protecting women.” Seven judges signed on to this decision, but two dissented. The dissenting view said that legalizing adultery hurts efforts to promote family in South Korea. It points to statistics showing 40% of South Korean marriages since 2000 end in divorce. And between 2000 and 2006, at least, 47. 1% of those divorces came about after one or more spouses cheated. ”Adultery and fornication go beyond a person’s rights (and) intrude on other people and the community,” these justices wrote. ”Considering that the relationship between husband and wife is the fundamental element of a family, the country and the society should legally protect and maintain (this) relationship.” The last time the South Korean court looked at this law was 2008. Since then, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap, some 5, 500 people have been indicted on adultery charges, though that doesn’t mean they ended up behind bars. It was not immediately clear what will happen to those cases, assuming they haven’t been resolved already. But at least one entity that has reason to celebrate after Thursday’s ruling, Unidus, a South Korean condom maker. It’s impossible to definitively say why, but Undius’ stock price did jump suddenly about 25 minutes after the decision came out. By day’s end, it was up a shade under 15% from Wednesday. "

41841,44129,63087,Mental illness is no crime,CNN,,2015-05-27,2015.0,5.0,," (CNN) Before Paton Blough got his bipolar disorder under control, it nearly cost him everything. The Greenville, South Carolina, resident was arrested six times in three years, each for an episode related to his illness. Instead of receiving treatment, he was thrown in jail. In the rough prison environment and without proper treatment, he ended up with two felony convictions for crimes committed while incarcerated.  Blough managed to find a path to treatment. That makes him one of the lucky ones. Today, mentally ill Americans are disproportionately more likely to be arrested, incarcerated, suffer solitary confinement or rape in prison and commit another crime once released. Quick: Name the largest provider of mental health care in America. If you guessed ”our prisons and jails,” you would be right.  A 2006 U. S. Department of Justice study found that three out of four female inmates in state prisons, 64% of all people in jail, 56% of all state prison inmates and 45% of people in federal prison have symptoms or a history of mental disorder.  America’s approach when the mentally ill commit nonviolent crimes    locking them up without addressing the problem    is a solution straight out of the 1800s.  When governments closed   psychiatric facilities in the late 1970s, it didn’t replace them with community care, and by default, the mentally ill often ended up in jails. There are roughly as many people in Anchorage, Alaska, or Trenton, New Jersey, as there are inmates with severe mental illness in American prisons and jails, according to one 2012 estimate. The estimated number of inmates with mental illness outstrips the number of patients in state psychiatric hospitals by a factor of 10.  Today, in 44 states and the District of Columbia, the largest prison or jail holds more people with serious mental illness than the largest psychiatric hospital.  With 2 million people with mental illness booked into jails each year, it is not surprising that the biggest mental health providers in the country are LA County Jail, Rikers Island in New York and Cook County Jail in Chicago.  Our system is unfair to those struggling with mental illness.  Cycling them through the criminal justice system, we miss opportunities to link them to treatment that could lead to drastic improvements in their quality of life and our public safety. These people are sick, not bad, and they can be diverted to mental health programs that cost less and are more effective than jail time. People who’ve committed nonviolent crimes can often set themselves on a better path if they are provided with proper treatment. The current situation is also unfair to law enforcement officers and to the people running our prisons, who are now forced to act as doctors or face tense confrontations with the mentally ill while weighing the risk to public safety.  In fact, at a time when police shootings are generating mass controversy, there is far too little discussion of the fact that when police use force, it often involves someone with a mental illness. Finally, the current approach is unfair to taxpayers, because there are far more   ways for a decent society to provide care to the mentally ill. Just look at Ohio, where the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction is projected to spend $49 million this year on medications and mental health care, on top of nearly $23, 000 per inmate per year. Paton Blough is proof that there is a better way. After eventually getting the treatment he needed, he is out of jail and now helps teach law enforcement officers effective ways to intervene with people with mental health needs.  His focus is just one of a surprising number of proven, effective solutions with broad support. Both advocates for the mentally ill and the law enforcement community have lined up in support of increased training for officers. The psychiatric community as well as those focused on reducing crime can all agree on expanding mental health courts, crisis intervention teams, and veterans’ courts. A new initiative, ”Stepping Up,” unites state and local governments and the American Psychiatric Foundation to promote   practices to tackle our overreliance on jail as mental health treatment, such as   counseling programs that reduce the chances of repeat offenders. State and local officials have shown us the way.  We’ve seen large communities such as   County, Florida, completely redesign their systems at every level, training police officers in crisis intervention, instituting careful assessments of new jail admissions and redirecting their mentally ill populations into treatment, effectively reducing the rates of  .  We’ve seen smaller rural counties faced with tight budgets collaborate with neighboring communities to pool their limited resources to pay for new programs and properly track progress to promote accountability. Perhaps most surprisingly in these partisan times, Republicans and Democrats in Congress are standing    to support mental health reform. The bipartisan Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act,   by Sen. Al Franken,   and Sen. John Cornyn,   in the Senate, passed unanimously out of the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. The legislation includes simple measures that would fund alternatives to jail and prison admissions for those in need of treatment and expand training programs for law enforcement personnel on how to respond to people experiencing a mental health crisis. The notion of bipartisan, comprehensive criminal justice reform is not just idle talk. It is happening. Both sides see practical alternatives to incarceration that can reduce prison populations, improve public safety, save lives and save money. If Congress moves swiftly to pass the great ideas now percolating in the House and Senate, it will become a reality. Take it from a conservative and a liberal: A good place to start is by addressing the needs of our mentally ill citizens in jails and prisons.   Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

41915,44228,63187,Feds drop hate crime investigation into hanged man,CNN,Mariano Castillo,2015-05-30,2015.0,5.0,," (CNN) Federal investigators, saying they could not determine the death of a black man found hanging in a tree was a homicide, will not pursue criminal civil rights charges in the case.  Otis Byrd, 54, was found in March hanging from a tree in the Mississippi woods with bedsheets around his neck.  The scene instantly raised the possibility of a lynching, and Byrd’s family said he had been acting normal before the his body was found.  But federal and state investigators say they did not find evidence that Byrd was murdered.  Justice Department and FBI officials met with Byrd’s family on Friday to let them know of the decision.  In a news release, the Justice Department said investigators ”conducted a comprehensive investigation,” but that upon review ”determined that there was no evidence to prove that Byrd’s death was a homicide.” ”Accordingly, the investigation into this incident has been closed,” the news release said.  Byrd’s body was discovered on March 19, during a search after his family reported him missing.  He was found hanged deep in a forest about 500 yards from the house he was renting.  A skullcap had been pulled over his head. That house was the last place where Byrd was seen, on March 2."
41983,44322,63284,Russian planes fly close to U.S. warship near Crimea,CNN,Barbara Starr,2015-06-01,2015.0,6.0,,"Washington (CNN) The U. S. Navy took the unusual step Monday of releasing video of a Russian   aircraft flying past the right side of the guided missile destroyer USS Ross in the Black Sea. The video was distributed to make clear that the airplanes and ship had a routine encounter, contrary to Russian reports. It shows a warplane approaching from the distance and then quickly zooming past the American vessel.   The Ross was 25 miles off the coast of Crimea in international waters when six Russian   went by. The Russian aircraft were not armed, according to a U. S. defense official, and the entire matter was considered routine. Russian media claimed that the planes forced the warship to head away from Russian territorial waters. But the U. S. Navy said the Ross never changed course and proceeded on its mission, which was in international waters. In a video released by U. S. Naval Forces Europe, one of the Russian planes is shown flying an estimated 500 meters (1, 640 feet) off the side of the ship at an altitude of 600 feet. The Navy said it would not have released the video if it didn’t want to publicly counter the Russian reports.   The incident comes as Defense Secretary Ash Carter warned about the danger of a summer offensive by   separatists, who have seized Crimea from Ukraine. ”We are looking at Russian activities, at the activities of separatists. It’s a serious possibility and a serious danger,” Carter told the BBC in an interview published Monday. "
42088,44466,63430,Baltimore police blame high crime on drugs,CNN,Ashley Fantz,2015-06-05,2015.0,6.0,," (CNN) Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts is asking for federal help to fight an uptick in crime in his city    an increase he largely attributes to looted drugs that have made their way to the streets of Baltimore.  At least 27 pharmacies and drug clinics were looted during riots after the April death of Freddie Gray, much more than previously reported, and as much as 175, 000 units of dosage narcotics are now on the street, he said.   That’s ”enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year,” he said. ”That amount of drugs has thrown off the balance on the streets of Baltimore.”  His comments come as turmoil continues to grip the city less than two months after Gray died from a spinal injury while in police custody. Six Baltimore police officers have been charged in Gray’s death.  There were 42 homicides in the city in May, the deadliest month since 1972. Authorities expect the number of doses on the streets will be higher, because not all pharmacies have accounted for the missing narcotics, according to a law enforcement official.  Some of the drugs looted include fentanyl, oxycodone, amphetamines, Adderall, hydrocodone, morphine and tramadol.   ”Criminals are selling those stolen drugs,” Batts said. ”There are turf wars happening which are leading to violence and shootings in our city.” Read: Is there a new crime wave on the horizon? Councilman: It’s more complicated than drugs, City Council member Carl Stokes said Thursday he does not entirely agree that the crime in Baltimore can be blamed on the proliferation of drug dealing. ”It is not simply a matter of more prescription drugs on the streets,” he said. ”Baltimore has always had a very high homicide rate for many years.” The law enforcement official agreed, telling CNN that while some of the violence is a byproduct of the looting, it is by no means  . Two members of the Bloods gang in Baltimore told CNN they are being unfairly blamed by police for the violence.  ”What they’re trying to do is take the fire and heat off of them,” said one gang member, who goes by Bones.  Stokes said the problem is more complex.  ”There’s more opportunity for the criminals in this city to do what they’re doing because leadership is failing and, frankly, because the Fraternal Order of Police    if they didn’t order it they have given some, again, not an order, but to say to their rank and file you don’t have to work as hard as you should be working, you don’t have to live up to your oath to serve and protect. . .. I think we have a horrible situation going on in this town,” Stokes said. He added that neighborhoods that are wracked with crime are now facing an even tougher situation. ”I know that the police officers have lost confidence and respect for their commander,” Stokes said, adding that he believes the majority of Baltimore residents have respect for and confidence in the police.  Stokes said he’s troubled by stories he’s heard from residents who he said have told him in the past few days that police in their neighborhoods are doing less. ”Unfortunately and crazily, police officers are actually telling average citizens, ’We’re not doing all of the extra things that we used to do, we’re not doing it and we’re not doing it because we’re upset with our leadership. ’” Stokes offered to bring those residents who’ve told him this on CNN’s air.  ”What I would welcome is that we had a leader, a commander, who knew what the hell was going on with his troops,” said Stokes. ”Because he has lost the confidence and respect of the police officers on the streets. He has lost the streets entirely in terms of the criminals out there.” The Baltimore Police Department did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment on Stokes’ remarks on Thursday, but Batts addressed similar reports last month that officers have coordinated a work slowdown, saying they aren’t holding back in protest and that the numbers spiked due to gang violence.  ”Multiple people” have been ”shot in groupings . .. leading us to believe there is a gang nexus to the shootings that have taken place.” Batts did acknowledge in May that he has heard from officers who worry they could face legal jeopardy for pursuing suspects in the wake of Gray’s death. ”I hope they realize that what their actions are and the fact that the community needs them,” Batts told CNN’s ”AC360.” ”When I’m going through the roll calls, what I share with them, Anderson, is the fact that remember why you came on this job and why you put that gun belt on, why you put that badge on, and why you wear that uniform every single day, for the grandmothers and the babies and the little ones.” Asked directly if Stokes wants Batts, who became commissioner in 2012, to resign, the councilman replied that he is ”two steps away” from that, but he doesn’t want to create more chaos in a city that’s struggling to recover and unify.  Drugs on the streets, A     Drug Enforcement Administration agent also said recently that he believes drugs are fueling Baltimore’s pressing crime problem. Gary Tuggle, the assistant special agent in charge of the DEA’s Baltimore district, blamed the violence on gangs and drug dealers not affiliated with the gangs selling drugs.  ”The uptick we are seeing, quite honestly, is the fact that they have space now and they are out and they’ve got the ability to deal drugs, and some feel they can deal with impunity,” Tuggle told CNN affiliate WBAL May 28. Tuggle said the looters specifically went after controlled narcotics like Vicodin, oxycodone and Percocet that drug stores keep on hand to serve a consumer market.  The DEA said one   tablet of OxyContin or oxycodone sells for $30 on the street. ”Conversely, one bag of heroin will only cost you between $10 and $15, so you see the economic value for these gangs in targeting these pharmacies,” Tuggle told WBAL. The DEA is working to reconcile what could be on the street to what each store had in stock.  He said investigators know that ”there were massive amounts” taken. Catherine Pugh, a Maryland state senator, said on CNN that drugs have always been a problem in Baltimore. More drugs logically means the problems will get worse, she said.  She was asked for her thoughts on the allegation that police aren’t proactively doing their jobs.  She responded, ”We need them to do their job, so whatever that takes to get them moving” including bringing in the U. S. Department of Justice to help them learn how to better police ”that’s what needs to take place.” Kiarra Boulware, an   who is working on her sobriety and going to school, said on Thursday that she doubted the crime in Baltimore is being chiefly driven by stolen prescription medicine.  She grew up in Freddie Gray’s neighborhood. She said she feels like police have been slower in response times. She recalled seeing a man get shot and waiting six minutes for an ambulance that feels too long to her, she said.  ”As a result of the riots we are in an environment now where we have to fend for ourselves,” she said. She doesn’t have any solutions. But she said it might help for the city to put greater emphasis on community policing so officers and Baltimore’s residents can learn to start to trust each other.  "
42089,44467,63431,Is a new crime wave on the horizon?,CNN,,2015-06-02,2015.0,6.0,," (CNN) After decades of a downward trend in crime, residents in some large U. S. cities wonder if a reversal is coming.  If you live in Baltimore, you know that May, with 43 homicides, was the deadliest month since 1972. Or if you are a Houstonian, you’ve probably heard that murders were up 45% through April compared to the same period in 2014.  The latest statistics in Milwaukee show a 103% spike in murders    compared with a year ago. In Atlanta, 41 people were killed in the first five months of this year compared with 27 in the same period last year, an increase of 52%. The spike in killings in these major cities would be troubling in itself at any time, but it is especially troubling now, when policing practices, race and social policies are regularly in the news.  The video of a gunman brazenly opening fire on another man in the Bronx in May, or another gunman caught on camera firing across the street at someone in Harlem in April, spread so swiftly online that it is fair to ask if a crime wave is on the horizon.  A review of murder statistics in major U. S. cities so far this year shows an unclear picture.  While Baltimore and Houston appear to be experiencing a crime wave, comparable cities like Dallas and Los Angeles are trending in the opposite direction.  In short, it is too early to draw conclusions of a shift in the trend for violent crime.  Anecdotal evidence, How telling is Baltimore’s deadly month of May? Of the 119 homicides recorded in Baltimore this year, more than   happened in May.  As the Baltimore Sun put it in an editorial, ”We don’t think it is at all unreasonable to start asking questions about leadership in a city that, over the last month, was less safe by some measures than it has been at any point in recorded history.” On Wednesday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said his office is asking for more federal resources    prosecutors and law enforcement officers    to boost the city’s response to the recent uptick in crime. Speaking at an event remembering a toddler who was killed by a stray bullet last year, Baltimore Mayor Stephanie   said last month that it is a ”very, very painful time in our city.” On the other extreme is Los Angeles. Because of its large population, the city notches one of the nation’s highest numbers of murders, but the trend has been shrinking violent crime.  CNN requested murder statistics for 2015 from a number of large U. S. cities. Some departments cooperated right away, while others asked for more time or formal open records requests. Among the departments that released statistics, the numbers reflected different periods. Some cities had murder statistics through May, others just through April.  For the cities where crime does appear to be trending upward, how can one know if it is a blip or a historic reversal?  ”It’s a little bit like the stock market. These statistics go up and down,” said Harold Pollack,   of the University of Chicago Crime Lab. ”It’s like asking why did the stock market go up 75 points today.” But numbers have the power to sway, and many of these figures are being used already to bolster arguments for stronger police enforcement or a reformed police presence.  Explaining the downward trend, As policing has changed over the years, the question of what the nationwide decreases in violent crime means has been debated.  There is general agreement that larger police departments    and more officers in the streets    has had a positive effect on lowering crime, Pollack said.  The quality of policing has also improved over the past 20 years and the departments are better managed, he said.  Other factors are harder to quantify.  The end of the crack epidemic is believed to have contributed to the decrease in violent crime, as have other reasons ranging from the legalization of abortion to changes in the illegal drug market.  This year ”may not be shaping up to be a terrific year in many cities, and it may be part of a larger pattern, but we really don’t know that,” Pollack said.  So what’s the debate right now? One obvious difference between last year and this year is the tensions between police officers and certain communities.  The   instances of police officers killing unarmed black men stirred outrage and protests.  There is an understanding that somehow things have changed    or must change    in a   Brown,   Gray,   Garner America.  The debate on whether police reform is needed or whether more aggressive policing is necessary is often political. The early 2015 murder statistics are providing evidence for both sides.  ”If there’s a national mood that starts to see police as the bad guys, the police as the enemy responsible for these problems, it makes it a hell of a lot harder to police,” said Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore police officer and professor of policing. ”One way that cops deal with that is that they just stop policing those people.” A former New York Police Department officer, Bill Stanton, agreed that an uptick in crime can be linked to police being less assertive.  ”When you take away police pride and you take away giving them the benefit of the doubt . .. and you’re going to call them racist and you’re going to prosecute them for doing nothing wrong,” Stanton said, ”then what happens is they’re going to roll back. They’re not going to go that extra mile.” CNN Political Analyst Van Jones said tying the protests over the deaths of unarmed black men to increases in crime is disingenuous. ”Police unions are trying to link any crime to First Amendment protests and   data,” he told CNN’s Erin Burnett.  ”This is all part of an attempt to tell black people that if we exercise our First Amendment rights, we are somehow now responsible for people who engage in crime,” he said. ”Why should the black community have to choose between police abuse and police neglect? That’s a false choice.” The fundamentals, The bottom line, statisticians say, is that there is not enough data to conclude if a new crime wave is upon us, or if there is, what factors are behind it.  Pollack suggested that looking at the available data through a political lens can distract from a focus on the fundamentals.  Nearly without exception, the protests over the killings of unarmed black men have been examples of police misconduct or mistakes, Pollack said.  All communities need and want good policing, and the focus should be on factors that are known to have lowered crime, he said.  Things like community policing and addressing other social issues in the communities have worked, he said.  ”Public safety is a joint product of the police and the community, and each side has to trust each other, and when that trust breaks down, it’s very hard for police to do its job and for the community to do do its part as well,” he said.  But with the current political climate, don’t be surprised if crime statistics become part of the discussion on race and policing.  ”The premise of the Black Lives Matter movement, that the police are the biggest threat facing young black males today, is simply false, and the animosity that’s directed to police on the streets today is having an effect,” Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute told CNN’s Chris Cuomo. ”I’ve heard from many officers that they are reluctant to engage in actions that could be misinterpreted on cellphone cameras.” The accusation from the other side is that there is an intentional effort to undermine the political support black protesters have garnered.  ”Conflation of the protests with a rise in crime and criminality itself kind of defames what the protests are about,” New York Times columnist Charles Blow told Cuomo.  "
42298,44754,63721,"Utah police investigate brutal attack, hate crimes",CNN,Tony Marco,2015-06-13,2015.0,6.0,," (CNN) Rick Jones sent the employees home from his family’s pizza restaurant and carried the garbage out the back door.  ”I thought it was strange that I didn’t hear it close,” he said. ”I was knocked out and then suddenly someone was forcing my legs and hands down and trying to get me to drink bleach.” Jones, 21, woke up a few hours later in the hospital with a concussion, serious bruises and a message of hate carved into the inside part of his arms.  ”On one arm it said ’die’ and on the other arm it said ’f*g’,” he said.  Unfortunately, he’d see those words again in coming weeks.  The assault was the first in a series of crimes committed against Jones, a lifelong resident of Delta, a town of about 3, 500 people in western Utah.  ’Hate crime investigation’ Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox issued a statement on Friday about the ”hate crime investigation.” ”I was horrified and   to learn of this cowardly and barbaric assault,” Cox said. ”The Jones family is an upstanding,   and beloved part of the Delta community. . .. This will not stand.” ”In all of my years I can’t remember anything like this ever happening before, so it’s something we want to get a handle on as soon as we can,” Millard County Sheriff Robert Dekker told CNN affiliate KSL. The criminals did more than hurt Jones that night. They took $1, 300 from the restaurant he owns with his three sisters, Grand Central Pizzeria and Grill. Then the crimes started to hit home. Literally. The following day, somebody went to the home in Delta where Jones lives with his parents and sisters and   the same malicious words onto the garage door. More than a month passed.  Molotov cocktail, On June 10, Jones woke up to the sound of a crash. Somebody had thrown a Molotov cocktail through his bedroom window.  ”It didn’t explode but it started a fire that burnt the wall and some of my carpet,” he said. ”It actually landed on my bed.

42739,45366,64339,Immigrants and crime: Crunching the numbers,CNN,Catherine E. Shoichet,2015-07-09,2015.0,7.0,," (CNN) With a presidential election looming, politicians on both sides of the aisle are sparring over immigration in a battle that shows no sign of stopping. Some are pointing to a recent case    a woman in San Francisco who was killed, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant who’d already been deported five times    as another sign that the U. S. system is in serious need of an overhaul. But what are the numbers behind the rhetoric? Here’s a look at some of the statistics, where they come from and what people on different sides of the debate say about them. 11. 2 million, That’s the latest estimate of the number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. And it’s less than 4% of the total U. S. population. The number peaked in 2007, according to Pew, when there were an estimated 12. 2 million unauthorized immigrants in the country. But since 2009, it’s ”remained essentially unchanged,” Pew reports, as the numbers of undocumented immigrants entering and leaving the United States ”have come into rough balance.” 177, 960, The number of undocumented immigrants deported last year who were convicted criminals, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  That’s 56% of last year’s total number of deportations, according to ICE, and it’s a group that the agency says it’s putting first when it comes to deciding which cases to prioritize. Ask someone like Republican presidential contender Donald Trump about this number and you’ll get an earful about how this statistic and others show rampant crime among undocumented immigrants. Immigrant advocates say that’s far from the truth, adding that it’s important to look at how the term ICE uses when it talks about convicted criminals    ”criminal alien”    is defined.  ”Government statistics on who is being removed from the country can be somewhat deceptive,” says Walter Ewing, a senior researcher for the American Immigration Council who helped author a report released this week that argues immigrants are less likely to be criminals than   U. S. citizens.  ”Immigrants who experience even the slightest brush with the criminal justice system, such as being convicted of a misdemeanor, can find themselves subject to detention for an undetermined period, after which they are expelled from the country and barred from returning,” the report says. ”In other words, for years the government has been redefining what it means to be a ’criminal alien,’ using increasingly stringent definitions and standards of ’criminality’ that do not apply to U. S. citizens.” 121   The number of people released from immigration custody who were later charged with murder between 2010 and 2014, according to figures from the Department of Homeland Security cited in a recent letter from two U. S. senators. That’s about a thousandth of a percent of the total estimated number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. Sen. Jeff Sessions and Sen. Chuck Grassley, both Republicans, have been pointing to this number as they push federal authorities for answers, arguing that ”countless innocent Americans every year are the victims of crime perpetrated by deportable criminals.” And the recent San Francisco shooting has added fresh fuel to the debate over whether authorities are doing enough to keep harmful offenders off the streets    and kick them out of the United States.  But other officials have stressed that it’s important to look at the big picture and not to make   decisions based on individual cases. ”On the issue of immigration,” California Attorney General Kamala Harris said this week, ”our policy should not be informed by our collective outrage about one man’s conduct.” 73, 665, The number of inmates in state and federal prisons who are not U. S. citizens, according to the latest prison population report from the Bureau of Judicial Statistics. That’s about 5% of the total prison population. In his recent push for building a massive wall on the southern U. S. border, Trump has said that there are ”hundreds of thousands” of undocumented immigrants in the nation’s state and federal prisons. It was a claim that the PolitiFact   website gave a ”mostly false” rating. ”The basic claim is at best unsustainable or more likely pure fiction. A fact created out of thin air,” Ramiro Martinez, a criminal justice professor at Northeastern University, told PolitiFact. The bottom line, PolitiFact says, is that it’s unclear just how many undocumented immigrants are currently in prison, because the available statistics don’t provide details about inmates’ immigration status.  Analysts on both sides of the immigration debate do agree on one thing: There’s a lack of good data about this. But as to how likely it is for immigrants to commit crimes, that depends on who you ask. In a 2009 report arguing that immigrants have ”high rates of criminality,” the Center for Immigration Studies pointed to statistics that  . S. citizens represent a quarter of the U. S. prison population. This week’s report from the American Immigration Council counters that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes and are overrepresented in the federal prison system. Citing the American Community Survey, the report also notes that the percentage of   men in the United States who are incarcerated (1. 6%) is less than the percentage of U. S.  men who are imprisoned (3. 3%). And the reason they’re behind bars is often tied to immigration offenses. ”While some may be there for committing a serious criminal offense, a great many more may be there because of an immigration violation,” the report says. 1 million, The number of   detainer requests issued by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement and sent to local authorities from 2008 to 2012, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. More than   of those were for immigrants who had no criminal convictions on their records. For the ones who’d been convicted, only 8. 6% were charged with serious offenses, based on federal standards. Federal immigration authorities use detainers to ask local agencies to hold unauthorized immigrants and eventually hand them over to the Department of Homeland Security. It’s a controversial approach that’s long drawn fire from immigrant rights advocates, who argue that the feds have used the tool inappropriately to detain and deport people who don’t deserve it. As a result, some places    like San Francisco    call themselves sanctuary cities and say they won’t honor those requests, demanding that federal authorities go through the courts. It’s a situation that’s been in the spotlight with this month’s shooting in San Francisco. Critics of the city argue that officials there erred when they didn’t let Homeland Security know they were releasing suspect Juan Francisco  .  In an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton said San Francisco should have listened to the Department of Homeland Security and made a mistake when it didn’t send   packing. ”I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. . .. If it were a   traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that’s entirely different,” she said. ”This man had already been deported five times. And he should have been deported at the request of the federal government.” San Francisco Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said his city has a good reason for their approach. ”Because of what has not been reconciled on the federal level,” he says, ”local governments and state governments are devising new laws.” 10, 182, The number of ICE detainers state and local enforcement authorities declined to honor last year. ”This required ICE to expend additional resources attempting to locate, apprehend and remove criminal aliens who were released into the community, rather than transferred directly into custody,” ICE said in its report on last year’s deportation statistics.  But when it comes to immigration detainers, there’s a long history of distrust between local and federal agencies, says Ruben Rumbaut, a professor of sociology at the University of California at Irvine.  ”The majority of people that were put in ICE detainers were in the end deported out of the country for reasons that have nothing to do with crime,” Rumbaut said. ”It’s become very controversial.”"

Sundays on CNN. Got a tip? Call     (In Mexico: 0188000990546) or click here. ”This case is what I’ve been talking about for years . .. One step ahead of the law, multiple victims, and the only reason his career was ended, because of you. You made the difference,” said John Walsh, who will profile the case of captured fugitive Johnny Napier this Sunday on his CNN series, ”The Hunt with John Walsh.” ”You had the courage to make that call, that’s how we catch these guys.” Arrested in Texas, In 2008, Napier was living in Comanche, Texas, working as a handyman.   He befriended Jennifer Campbell, a young single mother who worked a convenience store close to his house. Soon Napier was helping Campbell care for her    daughter. In 2009, Napier’s      Cheyenne told Campbell that she suspected Napier of touching Campbell’s daughter sexually.  Although the child denied it at first, she eventually admitted that sexual contact had occurred.  The Comanche County Police Department arrested Napier for indecency with a child.   ”I went ahead and agreed to bail Johnny out because he was a low risk,” bail bondswoman Ruth Shugart told CNN’s ”The Hunt with John Walsh.” ”I don’t even think he had a speeding ticket.” ”Monday morning when we go to court, he’s not in the courtroom,” she recalled. ”I thought, oh my God, he’s gone.  He’s on the run.” New state, new name, Napier made his way to Baker, Montana, where he adopted the name ”Sean Denning,” and got a job working for Robin and Dana Wright, a   team running an   facility. Dana had a    daughter of her own.   For the next two years, ”Denning” became an integral part of the business and the lives of the women    and the little girl.  He moved into Robin’s basement.  He bought toys and gave the girl a pet mouse.  He put up a sign in his bedroom: ”The Kid Zone.” One day, Dana Wright’s daughter innocently alerted her that ”Denning” had been touching her.   ”In April of 2012, my daughter and I were laying in bed, watching a movie,” Dana told ”The Hunt.” ”She tried to put my hand on her private areas, and I told her ’No, we don’t do that.’ And she said, ’Well, Sean does it. ’” Surprised and distressed, the Wrights decided to keep a closer eye on their employee but decide not to report their concerns to the police.  Months later, while visiting family in North Carolina, the child repeated her admission to relatives.  They immediately reported the allegation to the Child Protection office in Montana.  ”Denning” got wind of this and abruptly disappeared.   Making the connection, Initially, the police sent out a warrant for ”Sean Denning,” but when no leads materialized, the police and FBI coordinated a campaign on social media. That’s when Shugart, the bondswoman who had originally bailed Napier out on his Texas charges, saw the bulletin and put a name to the face    Johnny Benjamin Napier.   Working off of a tip, police arrested Napier in Springfield, Missouri, on November 20, 2014.  Napier has now been indicted for sex crimes involving four young children. He is incarcerated, awaiting trial in Comanche, Texas. He has not yet entered a plea. He is expected to be extradited to Montana for a second trial.

Other members of the law enforcement group include   current and former police commissioners and chiefs from several   major cities, including William Bratton, the former police   commissioner in New York and Boston and chief in Los   Angeles, as well as officials from Philadelphia, Baltimore,   Indianapolis, Charlotte, and Birmingham. ’ ’   The group called on Trump to back policies that would   specifically target violent crime, an apparent dig at an  the president signed last week, which the   group said only considers crime in general. ’ ’’ ’   ”Failing to direct these resources toward our most immediate and   dangerous threats risks wasting taxpayer dollars,” the officials   wrote. ’ ’   The group also pushed Trump to fight to reduce ”bloated prison   populations” with alternatives to jail time. Such   alternatives include directing mentally ill inmates toward health   facilities and expanding the use of halfway homes that offer   transitional support to inmates integrating back into   society. Better support for inmates reduces the chances of   them landing behind bars later in life, they said. ’ ’   ”We need not use arrest, conviction, and prison as the default   response for every broken law,” the officials wrote. ’ ’   Finally, the group recommended Trump invest in community   policing, wherein police forces collaborate with their   communities. The practice reduces crime and diminishes local   tensions between police and civilians, the officers wrote.  ’ ”   Not all police across the country share the group’s   views. Several police chiefs and union members prefer   Trump’s hardline rhetoric and vows to crack down on crime   nationwide, after eight years in which they perceived Barack   Obama as being soft on crime, .  ” ’A group of nearly 200 prominent veterans of law. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"
43827,46646,65749,Trump wants to publicize crimes committed by immigrants — critics call it ’scapegoating’,Business Insider,,2017-03-02,2017.0,3.0,,"’  ’ ’   President Donald Trump prompted audible groans during his   joint address to Congress on Tuesday night, when he brought up   plans to highlight crimes committed by undocumented immigrants   and create a Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE)   office. ’ ’   ”We are providing a voice to those who have been ignored by our   media, and silenced by special interests,” Trump said,   introducing four guests he had invited whose family members had   allegedly been killed by immigrants living in the US illegally. ’ ’   ”To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan, and Jessica: I want you to know  —   we   will never stop fighting for justice. Your loved ones will never   be forgotten, we will always honor their memory,” Trump said. ’ ’   The creation of  VOICE has prompted confusion and anger   among immigration experts and advocates, who have been quick to   point out that targeting criminal immigrants makes little sense   given crime statistics on the matter. ’ ’  ’ ’   ”The fact is, you can find crimes committed by any group, no   matter how you define them. Immigrants,   white men,   Latino men  —   you’’re going to find criminals of any demographic   category. And to choose one and blame them for crime in general   is just very disingenuous,” said Walter Ewing, a  who   added that VOICE is nothing short of ”scapegoating.” ’ ’   Given that there is no data that proves undocumented   immigrants are a demographic intrinsically prone to crime,   blaming immigrants as a group for crime is poor logic, Ewing told   Business Insider. ’ ’  ’ ”   Trump’s message wasn’t lost on his supporters, however, who   approved of the way he specifically addressed victims’ families. ” ’   ”What President Trump did, and no other candidate on   either side has acknowledged, is the tragic effects of illegal   immigration,” Maria Espinoza, national director of the   Remembrance Project, which advocates for victims of crimes   committed by unauthorized immigrants, told . ’ ’    A  released by Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly last   week detailed the department’’s plans for the office, including   the creation of a ”programmatic liaison” between its Immigration   and Customs Enforcement agency and victims of crimes committed by   unauthorized immigrants. ’ ’   The office will be funded by the resources that currently go   toward advocacy efforts for undocumented immigrants, according to   the memo, and the liaison will ensure the victims and their   families are given information about offenders, including their   immigration and custody statuses. ICE is currently ”drafting   outreach materials” for victims, . ’ ’   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called the VOICE program   ”ridiculous” on Wednesday, and said law enforcement should   be targeting all crime  —   not just those incidents that   involve immigrants. ’ ’   ”The overwhelming majority of immigrants are   they   want to be part of the American dream, and most Americans agree   with that,”  on CBS This Morning. ”So to put an office like this   out there shows how   this president is.” ’ ’   Drawing a connection between immigrants and crime with no   evidence can prove dangerous for undocumented immigrants who   may now find themselves targeted by   groups who   now feel ”emboldened” by Trump’’s presidency, Ewing said. ’ ’   Last week, for instance, a gunman allegedly opened fire on two   Indian men in an Olathe, Kansas bar, killing one and injuring the   other, as well as a bystander who tried to intervene. ’ ’   Alok Madasani, the injured victim,  that the shooter had asked the two   men whether they were in the country illegally and which visas   they held  —   questions which critics say were  to garner   political appeal. ’ ’   ”We are looking at some of not only the most   and     policies in our history, but also the creation of   this nativist, xenophobic culture that actually is what has   allowed for two guest workers from India to have been killed last   week,” Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National   Immigration Law Center  Wednesday. ’ ’   ”The hate crimes that have happened in this country since the   election have not happened in a vacuum. They have happened   because hate speech results in hate crimes and hate incidents.” ’ ’   The  has backed this assertion up,   calling 2016 an ”unprecedented” year for hate due to the growth   in the number of hate groups in the US to 917 from 892 the year   earlier. ’ ’   ”The country saw a resurgence of white nationalism that imperils   the racial progress we’ve made, along with the rise of a   president whose policies reflect the values of white   nationalists,” the SPLC’’s Mark Potok said. ’ ’   Trump addressed the Olathe shooting in his speech Tuesday,   following several days of criticism for not mentioning it sooner:   ”We are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil   in all its forms,” he said. ’ ”   But Ewing said Trump’s   rhetoric and policies have   already been percolating for some time  —   and he has now made   those ideas mainstream. ” ’   ”It’’s not that he’’s directly provoking them, but the     groups see his presidency as a validation of their   beliefs, and as a license to do what they’’ve always wanted to do,   which is attack immigrants either literally or figuratively,”   he said. ’ ’President Donald Trump prompted audible. ..’ ’’ ’’ ’’"

Clinton spent more than 10 minutes defending both his policy and his wife’s 1996 use of the term “superpredators” to describe young people accused of committing crime.’ ’“I don’t know how you would characterize gang leaders who got    kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other   children,” he said. “You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth. ”’ ’The comments enraged the protestors. One demonstrator held up a sign that read, “Clinton crime bill destroyed our communities. ”’ ’In reality, Pfaff said, Clinton’s reforms targeted federal crimes rather than state ones, which are not prosecuted at nearly as high a rate. Pfaff said the media and the public too often focus on federal legislation, when states and counties hold the real power in prosecuting criminals, running prisons, and lowering   rates.’ ’“There’s very little the feds can do to the states. They can’t tell states what to do. They can’t change state law,” he said.’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’tDefinitely. The states hold 87% of nation’s prisoners, the feds 13%. State sentencing always matters so much more.  ’ ’While Clinton’s reforms did offer “  ” incentives that offered billions of dollars to states to adopt harsh parole provisions for violent offenders, only  was a key factor in their decision to enact tougher sentencing laws, according to a report from the US General Accounting Office.’ ’The billions of dollars that were allocated for the grants went largely unclaimed, Pfaff said.’ ’On the other side of the debate, those who defend the 1994 bill for its   effect are equally mistaken, Pfaff added. While the bill authorized funding to hire up to a million police officers, it’s unclear how many were hired. Meanwhile, he said, crime rates had already begun to drop by the time the reforms took effect.’ ’’ ’ ’t’t’t3A. Reduced crime? No. Just no. No. No. To start, crime drop stated in 1991, not 1994. No change in trend in 1994.  ’ ’Clinton has since said he regretted his conduct during the encounter with Black Lives Matter protesters, and  for his remarks.’ ’“I know those young people yesterday were just trying to get good television,” he said Friday. “But that doesn’t mean that I was most effective in answering it. ”’ ’The hotly debated 1994 crime reforms that. ..’"

The US and France also walked   out. ” ’   ”It is difficult to deny that Russia is partnering with the   Syrian regime to carry out war crimes,” Rycroft said. ’ ’   Britain’’s newly appointed foreign secretary, Boris Johnson,   joined in the chorus of international condemnation shortly   afterward, telling the BBC’’s ”The Andrew Marr Show” that Russia   was ”guilty of protracting” the war in Syria and of ”making it   far more hideous.” ’ ”   Echoing the regime, Russia once again defended itself by   insisting the airstrikes were targeting Syria’s militants. ” ’   ”In Syria, hundreds of armed groups are being armed, the   territory of the country is being bombed indiscriminately, and   bringing a peace is almost an impossible task now because of   this,” Russia’’s ambassador to the UN, Vitaly Churkin, told the   council. ’ ’   The Kremlin’’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, called the US and UK   envoys’’ language ”unacceptable.” ’ ’   ”We note that the tone and rhetoric used by official   representatives from the UK and US is generally unacceptable and   it can seriously damage the settlement process and our bilateral   relations,” he  on Monday. ’ ’   Jeff White, a military expert at the Washington Institute for   Near East Policy, said that the jabs are, at this point, more   than just ”sound and fury.” ’ ’   Europe analyst Alex Kokcharov, a risk analyst with IHS, said the   language was ”probably the strongest we’’ve heard since the Cold   War ended.” ’ ’   ”This is significant  —   both the fact that the UN Security Council   met on a weekend and also that they have used words such as war   crimes,”Kokcharov . ’ ’  ’ ’   White noted that while the Obama administration is ”not going to   make a major policy change at this point, it may be willing to   increase clandestine support to the rebels somewhat.” ’ ’   Any concerted effort by the administration to end the   bombardments remains elusive, however.

And he   used the first presidential debate on Monday night to hammer home   his point. ’ ’   ”In New York City,    we had 2, 200 murders, and      brought it down to 500 murders,” Trump said. ’ ’   He continued: ’ ”   But a look at the statistics casts doubt on most of these claims,   especially Trump’s praise of    a policing tactic in   which officers can search anyone on the street that many today   consider unconstitutional and ineffective. ” ”   Let’s start with the    between Trump and Clinton on   whether crime in New York City has increased or decreased under   Mayor Bill de Blasio: ” ”   There has been a slight increase in    murders since   2013, when de Blasio was elected. According to the New York City   Police Department’s crime statistics database,  the city experienced 243 murders through     in 2013, 228 in 2014, 257 in 2015, and 246 in 2016.   The difference of three murders from 2013 to 2016 constitutes a   1. 2% increase. ” ’   But    total crime  —   a compilation of seven major   categories: murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary,   grand larceny, and grand larceny auto  —   has fallen significantly   since de Blasio took office.    crime as of     was at 78, 201 in 2013; 75, 916 in 2014; 73, 985 in   2015; and 72, 008 in 2016, according to Compstat. As a whole,   crime in those categories fell 7. 9% from 2013 to 2016. ’ ’   And that decrease happened while stops carried out   under    decreased as well. ’ ’ ’ ’ ’t’t’tOdd how wrong Trump is about crime in the city he lives in.  declined, so did murders. cc    ’ ’   J. Peter Donald, the assistant commissioner for communication and   public information at the NYPD, called the above a ”.” ’ ’ a     organization often at odds with the NYPD, confirmed the decline   in stops. The NYCLU relies on   data from NYPD   officers, however, which can prove problematic  —   especially   because a recent report found that in many cases officers   . ’ ’   Regardless, in 2013, New Yorkers were reportedly stopped by the   police 191, 558 times. By 2015, that number decreased to 22, 939,   according to the NYCLU. ’ ’   Over the past several years,    policing has gone by   the wayside across the US. In 2013, a judge ruled New York City’’s   use of it . And in 2015, a   report from President Barack Obama’’s  reported that   ”   campaigns harass   black and brown   citizens without contributing to public safety.” ’ ”   As for Trump’s claims that New York City went from having 2, 200   murders to 500 murders, he’s most likely referring to 1990,    up 17. 8% from the   previous year. More than two decades passed before that number   dropped below 500 in 2012. ” ’  ’ ”   Most important, New York City’s notable drop in murders   correlates to a nationwide drop in murders and crime, especially   in large cities. And while it’s hard to pinpoint a cause,   theories range from . ” ”   Though it’s difficult to isolate    as a variable,   simple data shows that crime continued to decrease even coupled   with a substantial decline in stops. ” ’   In 2002, when Michael Bloomberg  —   still a firm believer in     ’’s ability to ””  —   first took office as mayor, New Yorkers were   stopped by the police 97, 296 times, according to the NYCLU. Stops   peaked in 2011, still under Bloomberg’’s purview, with 685, 724   stops. By 2015, however, stops reached a   low of 22, 939. ’ ’   Despite a nearly 97% reduction in stops, the number of crimes   barely changed from 2011 to 2015. Crimes totaled 74, 566 in 2011,   compared with 73, 985 in 2015. ’ ”   While the decline in crime was starting to flatten out,  pointed to  a legal scholar and Columbia   University professor, and other researchers on Operation Impact,   a program under Bloomberg and Ray Kelly, then the police   commissioner, that placed newly graduated police rookies on foot   patrol in the city’s   neighborhoods, known as impact   zones. ” ’  ’ ”   The program presented an opportunity to study whether   investigative stops, or stops conducted with reasonable suspicion   that a crime had occurred, was occurring, or was about to occur,   contributed to New York’s stark decline in crime rate, according   to the authors. ” ’   The researchers concluded, however, that Operation Impact had a   ”statistically significant but relatively small association with   a reduction in total crimes.” That reduction was most pronounced   with    stops  —   which is not how a judge   ruled New York was conducting them in 2013. ’ ’   In fact, the study’’s authors warned against ”the cost of extra   intrusion and burdens on local residents that have no crime   reduction benefit.” ’ ’   Based on his research, Fagan told The Washington Post that   Trump’’s claims about    were ”not true, simply not   accurate.” ’"
